# Uppy + Companion + Custom Provider  Example

This example uses @uppy/companion with a dummy custom provider.
This serves as an illustration on how integrating custom providers would work

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:
```bash
npm install
```
That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:
```bash
npm run example custom-provider
```

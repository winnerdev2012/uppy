# Uppy + Python Example

This example uses a Python Flask server and `@uppy/xhr-upload` to upload files to the local file system.

## Run it

First run `npm install && npm run bootstrap && npm run build` in the root folder of the uppy project.

Then move into this directory (`examples/python-xhr`), and:

```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm start
```

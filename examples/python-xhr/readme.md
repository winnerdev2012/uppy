# Uppy + Python Example

This example uses a Python Flask server and `@uppy/xhr-upload` to upload files to the local file system.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:
```bash
npm install
```
That will also install the npm dependencies for this example.

Additionally, this example uses python dependencies. Move into this directory, and install them using pip:
```bash
cd ./examples/python-xhr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:
```bash
npm run example python-xhr
```

# Uppy + Node Example

This example uses Node server and `@uppy/xhr-upload` to upload files to the local file system.

## Run it

First run `npm install && npm run bootstrap && npm run build` in the root folder of the uppy project.

Then move into this directory (`examples/php-xhr`), and:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

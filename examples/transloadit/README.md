# Robodog

This example shows all the different Robodog APIs in action on a single page.
Robodog has been deprecated, so this example shows how to replicate Robodog
features without using it. If you are new with Uppy, this example is probably
not for you, as it is specifically aimed for Robodog users looking to migrate
out of it.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:

```sh
corepack yarn install
corepack yarn build
```

That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:

```sh
corepack yarn workspace @uppy-example/transloadit start
```

# Uppy in React Native Expo (Beta)

⚠️ In Beta

`@uppy/react-native` is a basic Uppy component for React Native with Expo. It is in Beta, and is not full-featured. You can select local images or videos, take a picture with a camera or add any file from a remote url with Uppy Companion.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the root repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then navigate to this directory and run it:

```bash
cd examples/react-native-expo
npm start
```

Then a tab will open in your browser with Expo UI, and you can choose to run the example in either an iOS or Android simulator, or right on your mobile device with an Expo app — might be easier, if you don’t want to install emulators.

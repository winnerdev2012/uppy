Welcome to Day 8 of our ongoing thirty-day blog post challenge toward the **Uppy 1.0 release on April 25**! Yesterday was the 1st of April, the day we really kickstarted our coding speedrun towards 1.0

The entire team during the weekly call yesterday iterated on the whole process again, moving a lot of cards from the `todo` lane to the `in progress` lane. This is what our board currently looks like.

## Done

- [Alex](https://transloadit.com/about/#alex) improved the design of the drag to upload stage. <br />

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) made list items even out using the `justify-content: space-between` CSS property.

## In Progress

- We are currently investigating an issue with `tuts-js-client` which affects uploads where the file size is larger than 500MB as reported in this [issue](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146).

- We are investigating more on `tus-js-client` fingerprints as they are identical for each file on React Native, the team is figuring out how to properly identify files on that platform, because [the standard file properties that tus-js-client relies on](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/master/lib/fingerprint.js#L10) are not available.

- We have our first WIP screenshot for the React Native implementation.

- Arthur is working on trying a 600MB upload, see if it crashes as reported in `tus-js-client` issue. Then set chunkSize, test the upload again and report back findings so we'll evaluate next steps.

- Abdel is working on fixing the serverless examples where WebSockets are terminated when Uppy is deployed to Lambda

- Evgenia is working on applying for [Browserstack's](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source?ref=pricing) Open source program, so we can test Uppy more and make sure 1.0 is without any issues.

- Ife is writing tests for implementation of the `tus-js-client`  URL storage


That's all the updates I have for you today. See you tomorrow for [Day 9](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-09/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!

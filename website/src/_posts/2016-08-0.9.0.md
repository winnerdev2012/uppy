We have just released Uppy 0.9.0. This release features new

<!-- more -->

## Ability to pause uploads, progress indicators & ETA
The most visible feature that has been added is the ability to pause and resume file uploads.

The upload dashboard now contains more information about uploads, such as the time remaining until an upload is finished. We have also added circular progress indicators to give better visual feedback on an upload's progress.

## Remote file uploads
Remote file uploading is now working again.

## Informer interface
We’ve added a new `Informer` plugin (tested with `Dashboard`, should also work anywhere else) that listens to `informer` events, like so:
``` javascript
bus.emit('informer', message, type, duration)
```
 and displays a message bubble for a certain amount of time. It’s useful to notify you when the internet connection is down (or back up):

Or when Uppy has successfully uploaded your files:

## Under the hood: UI refactors
Under the hood, we've made some changes to how the UI is structured.  We are taking a more component-ized approach.  For example, the rendering of Google Drive's UI has been separated into multiple smaller components that can be found in the [`plugins/GoogleDrive` folder](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/src/plugins/GoogleDrive).

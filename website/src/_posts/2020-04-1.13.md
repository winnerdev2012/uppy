Let’s dive right in:

## Dark mode

A little while ago we’ve [announced work in progress](https://mobile.twitter.com/uppy_io/status/1221070643543838721) on Dashboard’s Dark Mode. Happy to tell you it’s live now! You can try it on [the Dashboard example page](http://localhost:4000/examples/dashboard/).

</video>

There are three options available:

- `light` — the default
- `dark`
- `auto` — will respect the user’s system settings and switch automatically

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  theme: 'dark'
})
```

## Custom meta fields

This is big one! Thanks to @galli-leo, you can now add custom input fields, such as `<input type="telephone">`, `<select>` or `checkbox`, like this:

```js
.use(Dashboard, {
  trigger: '#pick-files',
  metaFields: [
    { id: 'caption', name: 'Caption', placeholder: 'describe what the image is about' },
    {
      id: 'public',
      name: 'Public',
      render: ({ value, onChange }, h) => {
        return h(
          'input',
          {
            type: 'checkbox',
            onChange: (ev) => onChange(ev.target.checked ? 'on' : 'off'), defaultChecked: value === 'on'
          }
        )
     }
    }
  ]
})
```

See [the docs](/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) and [PR #2147](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.

## Google Docs support in Companion

Companion now automagically converts GSuite documents, such as docs, spreadsheets and presentations, to `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.ppt` files that can be open in various applications. Full list of type-to-extension mappings:

```js
{
  'application/vnd.google-apps.document': '.docx',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.drawing': '.png',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.script': '.json',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet': '.xlsx',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.presentation': '.ppt'
}
```

Note that only documents under 10MB are converted. This is a limitation set by the Google Drive API.

## AWS S3

Aws S3 plugin now handles uploads internally, instead of deferring to XHR Upload. This change fixes many bugs with Aws S3. See [PR #2060](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.

## Locales

Polish, Croatian and Romanian language pack have been added by @alfatv, @dkisic and akizor :tada:

## Exifr in Thumnail Generator

[@MikeKovarik](https://github.com/MikeKovarik) created an awesome library called [Exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr), useful for extracting EXIF image data. He was kind enough to submit a PR that replaces Uppy’s inlined `exif-js` with `exifr`. Our thumnail generation is now faster and more robust! See [PR 2140](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2140) for details.

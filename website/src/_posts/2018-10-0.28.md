## Single Uploads

Uppy has been flexible about uploading lots of things from the start. You can add files at any time, even after uploads have already started. This is neat, but not always the desired behaviour: sometimes, you just want to upload a few files together with a form. In that case, it's useful to allow users to only upload a set of files _once_. 0.28.0 adds some options to help!

An upload in Uppy terminology can be more than one file. Users can add a bunch of files, and when they press "Upload" all those files are bunched up into an upload. They can then add more files, and press the "Upload" button again: the _new_ files are bunched into a second upload.

The new [`allowMultipleUploads`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#allowMultipleUploads-true) option in Uppy Core can be set to `false` to only allow a single one of those uploads. Once an upload is started, the Dashboard and Status Bar no longer show "add files" and "upload" buttons. You can listen for a 'complete' event and then safely continue your app's form flow.

The Dashboard also has a new option: [`closeAfterFinish`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#closeAfterFinish-false). When `true`, the modal Dashboard will automatically hide once an upload has completed. You should only use this option in conjunction with `allowMultipleUploads`, otherwise it might close the Dashboard when the user isn't done yet! It can only be used with the modal Dashboard, when [`inline`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#inline-false) is set to `false`. "Closing" an inline Dashboard makes no sense :smile: You will see a warning in the console in both cases, so you don't have to remember all that.

## Transloadit Preset

Lately, we've been working on a wrapper package around Uppy and the [Transloadit plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/) that will make common Transloadit-based workflows much simpler to implement. It's not ready just yet, but it should land in the next month!

This "preset" will provide three or so simple methods:

 - `transloadit.form()`, to enhance a form with existing file `<input>`s with Transloadit encoding capabilities, powered by Uppy's resilient uploading plugins
 - `transloadit.modal()`, to show a one-off modal Dashboard that uploads to Transloadit's encoding backend
 - `transloadit.upload()`, to simply upload files, so you can build your own UIs instead

Stay tuned!

See you in the next release!

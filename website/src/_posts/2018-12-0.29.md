`0.29` brings bug fixes and improvements, while we are busy working on Uppy React Native support (which is already [coming to our resumable file upload protocol tus.io](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/132)) and a Transloadit Preset. Importantant highlights of this release are: separate Core and plugin styles, using file sizes for progress calculation, `responseType` option for XHR Upload and some visual Webcam bug fixes.

## Separate Core and Plugin styles

**‚ö†Ô∏è breaking**

When installing `uppy` and plugins from npm, you had to include their styles. Prior to this release, you could only include the plugin‚Äôs style, say, for `@uppy/webcam` you‚Äôd include its CSS:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam'
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'
```

Now you have to include ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù styles from `@uppy/core` as well:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam'
import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css'
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'
```

Please [see documentation for the plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/plugins/) you are using to find out whether it requires a CSS file to work. Generaly UI plugins, such as Dashboard, Webcam and Status Bar need a CSS file, while utility plugins, such as Tus or XHR Upload, don‚Äôt.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important things to remember:

1. Dashboard is a universal UI that comes with Status Bar and Informer plugins built in, and as such Dashboard styles already come with Informer and Status Bar styles.
2. Dashboard also ships with ‚ÄúRemote Provider‚Äù styles ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to include anything besides `@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css` for Google Drive, Instagram and Dropbox to work. However, Url and Webcam plugins, still have to be included manually. Here‚Äôs an example:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Dashboard from '@uppy/webcam'
import GoogleDrive from '@uppy/google-drive'
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam'
import Url from '@uppy/url'

// Core and Dashboard styles, then Webcam and Url, but not for GoogleDrive ‚Äî
// those come with Dashboard 
import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css'
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css'
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'
import '@uppy/url/dist/style.css'
```

## Using File Sizes For Progress Calculation

When possible, file sizes are now used for calculating the total progress. Before, we‚Äôve used uploaded percentage for each file. That meant, if you were uploading 4 files, and 3 small were already uploaded, while one very large was still in progress, Uppy would display progress as 90%. Long story short, Uppy now has a more accurate progress bar üöÄ 

Some internal details, if you are interested:

1. If there are files without sizes, the average size of all other files is assumed for the unsized files.
2. If there are no files with sizes, the percentage is just based on the percentages of the unsized files.

## responseType For XHR Upload

When using XHR Upload (or S3, that uses it internally), you can now configure the XMLHttpRequest `.responseType` value. Allows the S3 plugin to tell Firefox not to log XML errors when getting empty responses, so it finally fixes bugs that were caused by this, see #518.

Because AwsS3 now sets responseType: 'text', we can no longer use the responseXML property. We already did text based parsing for successful responses, and now do the same for error responses.

Uppy 1.8, 1.9 and a few important security patches are out! Here’s are the highlights:

<!--more-->

## Companion: new Instagram API and security patches

## Error handling

* We’ve significantly improved error handling and retries in `@uppy/core`, `@uppy/transloadit` and `@uppy/dashboard`. Retry button on the Status Bar, which was broken in some edge cases, now works as expected.
* Errors from Transloadit assemblies now include Assembly ID, as well as the full assembly object, for easier debugging.
* You can now click on the question mark (?) icon on the Informer or Dashboard error message, and get a browser alert with error details — much easier for the users to copy-paste the text this way. The Informer now also conveniently stays on screen, while the (?) is hovered.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard plugin has gained new file type icons: for images — useful before the preview is generated, or when there’s no preview at all, like with images from the Url plugin — and for archives.

## Types

We now use `tsd`, so our typings test files can actually assert that types are correct.

`PluginOptions` type parameter has been added to to `Uppy.Plugin` for type-checking plugins, while the `uppy.use(typeof Plugin, options: object)` overload has been removed.

See [PR #1918](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1918) for details.

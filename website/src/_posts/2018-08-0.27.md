In `0.27` we are iterating on the Dashboard UI again (getting rid of the permanent tab bar, plus tons of improvements)

<!--more-->

## Dashboard UI without tabs

Uppy used to always display the tab bar (the one you use to select between importing files from Instagram, Webcam, local disk, etc). This was not working well when many providers with the growing list of sources we support, especially on mobile.

So in `0.27` we are iterating on the UI again:

The list of icons is visible on the initial screen (plus, we’ve added colors!), but when you complete the inital selection, it’s hidden behind the “plus” button:

You can always add more:

The StatusBar that shows progress has been “lightened”:

Informer messages now always appear in a gray round bubble, we’ve dropped the multiple color support. Plus tons of small fixes like better animations, colors, font sizes and more, [check out the PR #942](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/942) for details.

We are aiming to make the UI less heavy, so that Uppy can easier fit within your excisting site or app design.

Mobile version is now much nicer as well:

As always, feel free to [try Uppy live on the Dashboard example](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## `autoProceed: false` by default

⚠️ **breaking**

By default, Uppy used to begin uploading right after you selected a file. If you wanted to let users edit some file metadata or pick and choose from multiple sources first, you had to set `autoProceed: false`:

```js
// this line could be seen in many of the Uppy examples
const uppy = Uppy({ autoProceed: false })
```

Since in most cases we actually wanted `autoProceed: false`, this is now the new default. Make sure you changes this in your project if needed. If you weren't setting an `autoProceed` option at all, you'll now have to add `autoProceed: true`.

## Progress on React Native

We’ve begun working on supporting React Native in Uppy. Since `0.27` it should run in React Native environment — meaning you can use Uppy API (`uppy.addFile()`, `uppy.upload()`) for adding files and uploading, without the UI. `@uppy/xhr-upload` uploader is already supported, and we are working on making `@uppy/tus`(and `tus-js-client` itself) run in React Native too.

Next we plan to make sure all non-UI Uppy plugins work in RN, and then provide useful components for adding Uppy to your RN apps.

Please head the [React Native PR #988](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988), for details and let us know what you think, and how we could improve the Uppy React Native experience.

## Package sizes

We now have a cool table showing mingzipped bundle sizes for each individual Uppy package, [check it out](https://uppy.io/docs/stats/#bundle-sizes):

## Uppy Server is now Companion

```bash
npm install @uppy/companion
```

Uppy Server is an optional service that Uppy can use to import files from sources like Instagram or Dropbox. However simply naming it "Server" was quite unclear and has caused confusion. Many people thought you could upload files to Uppy Server, as well, but that's not the case. So, we're renaming it to Companion: an optional tool you can use to add more functionality to your Uppy uploader.

Simultaneously we moved Uppy Companion into the main [transloadit/uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy) monorepo. This centralizes Uppy issue reporting, and makes it easier to do updates and simultaneous releases of the client and Companion parts.

The first release of `@uppy/companion` is 0.14, and the last `uppy-server` release is 0.13.4. `uppy-server` will be deprecated on npm soon.

Note that despite the rename, configuration for standalone Companion still uses `UPPYSERVER_` environment variables. This should ease the transition, since you'll only have to update the package name for now. `COMPANION_` variables will be used instead in the future, of course we'll notify you when the time comes!

## Other Cool Changes

- @uppy/core: allow editing plugin titles (names) so that e.g. “Camera” can be translated into different languages, fixes #920 (#942 / @arturi)
- @uppy/dashboard: fix animation — wait for closing animation to finish before opening modal (#942 / @arturi)
- @uppy/url: fix Url plugin reacting to wrong drop/paste events, add ignoreEvent (#942 / @arturi)
- build: build: Split integration tests and add one using create-react-app (#952 / @goto-bus-stop)
- @uppy/companion: google Drive — move to v3 API (#977 / @pauln)

See [full changelog (0.27 and 0.26.x patches) for more](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0270)

See you in the next release!

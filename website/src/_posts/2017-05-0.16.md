This release was in the works longer than usual, but its also cooler than usual, so lets get right to it.

## Transloadit integration beta

...

It’s here, it works, its still in beta, its awesome nevertheless, its optional.

## DOM element in `target:` option, `uppy.close()` for tearing down an Uppy instance

...

## More work on high-level React components

...

## Server time!

- parallelizing downloading/uploading remote files: start uploading chunks right away, while still storing the file on disk
- Image thumbnails are now also shown for remote files
- Tests have been added

...

<!-- more -->

## And

- Multiple necessary chores (the kind you don’t talk about at parties, well, maybe), like replacing `babel-preset-es2015-loose` by standard es2015 preset with `loose` option
- Merge tus-js-client options with uppy-tus
- Service logo is now visible on the file in the Dashboard
...

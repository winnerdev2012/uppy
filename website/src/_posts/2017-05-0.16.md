Hello there! Missed us? :) This release was in the works longer than usual, but its also cooler than usual, so lets get right to it.
<!-- more -->

## Transloadit integration beta

Yes you read that right! We now have an easily integrable [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) plugin. It was a big push indeed and many thanks to [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) for going beast mode on this. It's still in beta, but it works, and it's awesome nevertheless. Oh yeah and also its optional.

## DOM element in `target:` option, `uppy.close()` for tearing down an Uppy instance

...

## More work on high-level React components

...

## Server time!

We have it covered front-to-back so be sure we also got some things going on the server side.

- parallelizing downloading/uploading remote files: start uploading chunks right away, while still downloading the file on disk.
Even though the server may download files relatively faster, it is good to know that you don't have to wait out the download before the upload begins. :)
- Image thumbnails are now also shown for remote files.
- Automated tests have been added using the test library, [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
- Remote files are now deleted from local disk immediately after a successful upload.

## And

Multiple necessary chores (the kind you don’t talk about at parties, well, maybe), like:

- Replacing `babel-preset-es2015-loose` by standard es2015 preset with `loose` option
- Merged tus-js-client options with uppy-tus
- The Service logo is now visible on the corresponding file in the Dashboard. For example if a file is being uploaded from
Google Drive you would see a goolge drive logo easily identifying where the file is from. Take a look!

- We reviewed the uppy-server README to be more elaborate when getting started.

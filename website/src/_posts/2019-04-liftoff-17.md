Today marks the seventeenth day in our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge, working our way towards **launching Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. The Uppy team is dealing with the big tasks now, and the updates might be a little scanty!

## Done

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) updated the [React Native](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) UI example. Here is what the new UI looks like:

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) updated the focus styles on the Uppy Dashboard, such that it is no longer the ugly border it used to be. Here is what it looks like now:

## In Progress

- Artur is reviewing PRs, reporting errors and testing Uppy to see where Uppy might break. 

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) continues [improving Uppy's UI](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/master...nqst:design-facelift) and has recently been refactoring CSS code, while Evgenia keeps charging at the [many accessibility issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) that are still open.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) is working on the new drag/drop implementation where there will be a new `Drop Here` placeholder and we will not be experiencing any flickering. She is also working on  `drop folder` support for cross-browser compatibility, where we wonâ€™t be relying on DOM manipulation in our React components.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) is updating this [PR](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73) that deals with supporting resumability for Node.js environments


That's all from me today. As I mentioned, we are now on the big tasks, and as such, the update is scanty. Remember to keep tabs on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) for more Uppy updates. Day 18 is coming up next!

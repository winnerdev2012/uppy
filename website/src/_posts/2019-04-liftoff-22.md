We will launch **Uppy 1.0 on April 25** and this is our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge where we share updates on our progress each day! Let's see what happened on Day 22.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) have been pairing on [language packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443) and are nearly done with it :tada:

After this, it will be just as easy to maintain language/locale packs as it will be to switch Uppy to your favorite language. Fun fact, we experimented a bit with Google Sheets + Google Translate to automatically create a first swing for a few language we want to launch with:

It kinda worked! Google automatically Translates to target languages in each column we add, for each change we make in the original! In the end, we thought the translations where maybe a harder starting point than English, but it was a fun experiment and it's cool to see where this is all heading!

Artur will also be reviewing the many PRs that have been submitted by Transloadians and outside contributors.

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) finished his redesign for the new website:

..and will start implementing it today! He also worked on more [design improvements for Uppy itself](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1452).

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) is investigating incorrect progress reporting / uploads with XHR and Companion

- [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) finished work on making Robodog work with an [inline dashboard](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1450), as well as fix a bug in how we log to the console. Up next, Renée will work on error reporting for the Transloadit Plugin.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) finished here work on [drag and drop improvements](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440) and will continue working on accessibility improvements


Our goal is in sight, so we're starting to get pretty excited! Keep us in your thoughts by giving us a follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or subscribing to regular updates on [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml). Day 22 is up next, so you can look forward to another lovely post from Kevin!

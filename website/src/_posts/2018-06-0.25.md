Uppy 0.25 brings drag drop links or images from webpages, improved selecting in provider view, interactive components in i18n strings.

## i18n Strings With Interactive Components

⚠️ **breaking**

We’ve changed how i18n strings work with interactive components. We now use placeholder for those interactive buttons, so it works nicely in languages that have different word order than English. Example:

```js
dropPasteImport: 'Drop files here, paste, import from one of the locations above or %{browse}'
browse: 'browse'
```

`%{browse}` will be replaced with a button/link.

We can’t do this in all situations yet, because some parts of some strings need to be wrapped in Preact elements, which the Translator can’t handle.

Here’s a list of strings that were changed in this release, please update those in your locales:

- core: `failedToUpload` needs to contain `%{file}`, substituted by the name of the file that failed
- dashboard: `dropPaste` and `dropPasteImport` need to contain `%{browse}`, substituted by the "browse" text button
- dashboard: `editing` needs to contain `%{file}`, substituted by the name of the file being edited
- dashboard: `fileSource` and `importFrom` need to contain `%{name}`, substituted by the name of the provider
- dragdrop: `dropHereOr` needs to contain `%{browse}`, substituted by the "browse" text button

See full list of locale strings for each plugin you are using on [Uppy Docs](/docs/).

## React Documentation

React docs have been improved: we now have a separate page for each Uppy React wrapper component we offer.

- The id option is listed on each plugin's documentation page.
- The replaceTargetContent option is listed on UI plugin documentation pages.
- The locale option is described on each plugin documentation page, and includes a short description for each string. The default value is removed from the snippet at the top of the ## Options section to save some space (since it's a very large object sometimes).

## Drag & Drop Links or Images From Webpages

## Select In Provider View Vefore Adding Files

Selecting files doesn’t add files to Uppy immediately anymore. Instead a “Select” button appears (with a counter), and pressing that adds all the files with checked checkboxes and closes the Instagram or Google Drive overlay. Cancel discards the selection and also closes the overlay.

This addresses an undesirable case where `autoProceed: true` would begin uploading files the moment you ticked a checkbox, and you couldn’t see what was going on because the provider overlay was still open.

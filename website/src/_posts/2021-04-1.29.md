## Golden Retriever

[Golden Retriever](/docs/golden-retriever/) (`@uppy/golden-retriever`) is Uppy’s innovative plugin that recovers user’s files after an accidentally closed tab/window or a browser crash. Golden Retriever was first [introduced a few years ago](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/), during Transloadit’s company meetup in Berlin, and now finally got a proper refactor.

In this release, we’re adding support for “ghosts” — files that we’ve restored the metadata for, but couldn’t recover the data blob itself (usually due to its size). In this case, users will see a ghost icon over the file and a “re-select” button to pick the file again.

You can try Golden Retriever in action on [the Dashboard example page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## Dashboard: `disableLocalFiles`

`disableLocalFiles: true` option will disable drag & drop, hide the “browse” and “My Device” button, allowing only uploads from plugins, such as Webcam, Screen Capture, Google Drive, Instagram.

## Webcam Previews

When recording a video with `@uppy/webcam` plugin, you will now be given a chance to play it back and review before submitting. If you happen to not like the way glitch crab mask you’ve used, you can re-record the video using a more appropriate baby Yoda or duckface mask.

## uppy.logout()

When your users logs out of your app, you might want to also log them out of any cloud providers they might have used through Uppy, for extra security.

`uppy.logout()` calls `provider.logout()` on each remote provider plugin, like Google Drive, Instagram, Dropbox etc.

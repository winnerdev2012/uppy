Holy shit! I can't believe this is the final day of our push to get Uppy to 1.0. There's still a bunch of things that we'd like to finish before shipping, let's dive right in.

- [Tim](https://github.com/tim-kos) added additional information to the [migration guide](https://uppy.io/docs/robodog/form/#Migrating-From-the-jQuery-SDK) so Transloadit customers looking to move from the jQuery SDK to Uppy Robodog will have an easier time doing so. Tim also finished the [German Locale Pack](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1475)

- [Abdel](https://github.com/kiloreux) [translated](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1481) Uppy to French <img src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20061212?s=460&v=4" width="16" align="absmiddle">

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) [documented](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1468) the Thumbnail Generator plugin and made a few more hardcoded English strings translatable via Locale Packs. For instance, we can even translate "[Powered By](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/6d36309b72b62e215caa172a6300a0f0c7083ce8)" now 

We also had a team call where we discussed which items we can leave behind for the launch, and which ones we'd really like to get in. To save time for working on these tasks, instead of typing, let me share a screenshot of what we agreed upon:

It's gonna be a close call, especially [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) has a lot on his plate still with that ["600MB issue"](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146) untackled, but we did get [Marius](https://github.com/Acconut) on board with the way we want to solve it, so now it's full steam ahead.

Before I'm going back to the team and help out where I can, I'd like to thank you for reading along with us for these past 30 days. To be honest, at times we regretted making this commitment, but we learned a lot, and it was fun to share our development process with the world and give interested developers a better understanding of what we're trying to accomplish.

I hope to see you tomorrow again for our 1.0 release! Make sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or via our [RSS feed](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) if you don't want to miss it!

Hi! Its been another month and we have released a new version of Uppy. Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve been up to.

## Thinking about the future ðŸ”®

Weâ€™ve spent quite a lot of time thinking about what direction Uppy will be heading in the future.  Our major concern is making it as flexible as possible and compatible with popular libraries, such as React and React Native.  We also want to make it easy to port Uppy to any environments or ecosystems that are not officially supported.

We've done a lot of research. We created [prototypes of Uppy React components](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react).  We also created a new module that we like to call "Uppy Base." [`uppy-base`](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base) is a thin module that contains reusable functionality from some of our plugins that can be used in any ecosystem or environment, without the being opinionated about the UI.

Finally, we are also discussing using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) as the internal state management store within Uppy.  You can check out the drafts for that work in the `plugins` and `core` folder.  [Here are some plugin drafts](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/src/plugins/ReduxPluginDrafts) and [here is a draft of a new Core using Redux](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/src/core/ReduxCoreDraft.js).

Have a look at the [Uppy Base repository here](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base).

Check out [our Uppy React wrapper and components](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react), which are built on top of Uppy Base.

Finally, we have also played a bit with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules) and [CSJS](https://github.com/rtsao/csjs).  We've also tried generating preview thumbnails in Web Workers, and with [Pica library](https://github.com/nodeca/pica).

We would love to hear feedback on all of this.  Please join our discussion at: https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/116

Also, feel free to join in on other issues or open new ones!

## Dashboard: refreshed look and new features

In an attempt to be brave and keep things simple, weâ€™ve removed the dashed border from inside the Dashboard, rewritten its layout with flexbox, and tried out a new [blend-in-with-the-background-and-blur](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1199054/18763191/35d31ddc-80da-11e6-9a2c-c46388857135.png) mode.

There is now an option to render Dashboard inline on the page, instead of a default full modal dialog. To try it out, set `inline: true` in options, like this: `uppy.use(Dashboard, {target: '.myContainer', inline: true})`.

Weâ€™ve also added a circular progress bar that shows total upload progress, combined with a pause all / resume all button, and an info panel that shows speed, ETA and status for all uploads currently in progress. So you have something fun and useful to look at while you are waiting.

And, donâ€™t miss out on the new Copy Link button that appears after a successful upload, right where edit button usually is. I know, thatâ€™s pretty exciting! It gets better: when you click on it, the link is copied to your clipboard. Or, in less capable browsers, a window pops up with a text link, so you can copy it yourself. Bananas.

## Google Drive UI improved

The UI for Google Drive has received a fresh new redesign.  Check it out!

## Listen to events

Weâ€™ve finally begun to expose events on the `uppy` instance, so you can subscribe to them and use them in your app. For example, to display an image in your UI after itâ€™s been successfully uploaded:

``` javascript
uppy.on('core:upload-success', (id, url) => {
  var img = new Image()
  img.width = 300
  img.alt = id
  img.src = url
  document.body.appendChild(img)
})
```

There is also `core:upload-progress` to track progress and `core:success` for when all uploads are complete. The [event documentation](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#api) is quite small right now, weâ€™ll be adding more once we sort out the API.

## Thereâ€™s more

* i18n strings now extend default en_US dictionary: if a certain string is not available in a language, the English string will be displayed.
* Updated readme: improved usage docs and CDN links. Check out [the new usage section](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#usage) for yourself. Import, require or script tag? In any case, weâ€™ve got your back.
* Capabilities: We have added "capabilities" to the state.  For example, if tus resumable uploader is used, `capabilities.resumable === true` is added to the state, so it's easy to check what upload capabilities are available. More to come.

## Release Notes

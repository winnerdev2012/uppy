Hi! Its been another month and we have released a new version of Uppy. Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve been up to.

<!-- more -->

## Thinking about the future ðŸ”®

Weâ€™ve spend quite a while thinking about what the future will be like for Uppyâ€™s internal APIs, and how to make it flexible and compatible with popular libraries, such as React and React Native. Research has been done among with  prototypes of Uppy React components and extracting base versions of plugins into Uppy Base.

@TODO links to react examples or discussion issues maybe?

We also played a bit with CSS Modules and CSJS, generating preview thumbnails in Web Worker and tried Pica library.

## Dashboard: refreshed look and new features

In attempt to be brave and simple weâ€™ve removed the dashed border inside the Dashboard, rewritten its layout with flexbox and tried out a new [blend-in-with-the-background-and-blur](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1199054/18763191/35d31ddc-80da-11e6-9a2c-c46388857135.png) mode.

There is now an option to render Dashboard inline on the page, instead of a default full modal dialog. To try it out, set `inline: true` in options, like this: `uppy.use(Dashboard, {target: '.myContainer', inline: true})`.

Weâ€™ve also added a circular progress bar that shows total progress, combined with a pause all / resume all button, and an info panel that shows speed, ETA and status for all uploads currently in progress. So you have something fun and useful to look at while you are waiting.

And, donâ€™t miss out on the new Copy Link button that appears after a successful upload, right where edit button usually is. I know, thatâ€™s pretty exciting! It gets better: you click on it, and the link is copied to your clipboard. Or, in less capable browsers, a window pops up with a text link, so you can copy it yourself. Bananas.

## Google Drive UI improved

Google Drive has been refreshed too ... @TODO add about the new UI a bit

## Listen to events

Weâ€™ve finally begun exposing events on the `uppy` instance, so you can subscribe to them and use in your app, for example to display an image in your UI, after itâ€™s been successfully uploaded:

``` javascript
uppy.on('core:upload-success', (id, url) => {
  var img = new Image()
  img.width = 300
  img.alt = id
  img.src = url
  document.body.appendChild(img)
})
```

There is also `core:upload-progress` to track progress and `core:success` for when all uploads are complete. The [event documentation](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#api) is quite small right now, weâ€™ll be adding more once we sort out the API.

## Thereâ€™s more

* i18n strings now extend default en_US dictionary: if a certain string in not available in German, English will be displayed.
* Updated readme: improved usage docs and CDN links, checkout [the new usage section](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#usage) for yourself. Import, require or script tag? In any case, weâ€™ve got your back.
* Capabilities: if tus resumable uploader is used, `capabilities.resumable === true` is added to the state, easy to check for by any plugin or human interested. More to come.

## Done

- [Artur](https://transloadit.com/about/#artur) and [Kevin](https://transloadit.com/about/#kvz) [fixed CI builds](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/130b79076c4cee54f1d6045f7ff359d1f46a9c72) with [new](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/5f4f1cf17e23c195d4a3907d7bb94599ec882ae6) [npm](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/f0ca917a1e238e672540fd1a605c2dee8a81b195) scripts (now explicitly opt into running Companion via `npm run dev:with-companion`) and by switching to a newer Chrome version for Windows 7 on Saucelabs. Kevin cut down website deploy times by leveraging cache.
- [Ife](https://transloadit.com/about/#ife) [fixed](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/c1abfea33d0c3e80809814c1048b156028c8fcf9) a [bug](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1390) in XHR Companion uploads 
- Then Ife, Artur, and Kevin paired for the entire afternoon on resumable uploads in RN, and got it to work inside an upload session, you can now hit Pause & Resume :tada: It does not after a crash yet, more on that in `In Progress`. One of the big hurdless addressed during the call was fixing websocket communication between Companion RN, so remote uploads done by Companion now report progress to the mobile app
- [Renée](https://transloadit.com/about/#renee) fixed [a TypeScript issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1396) for people who do `allowSyntheticDefaultImports: false`
- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) has [removed jumpiness](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1383) that can be witnessed when Uppy is loading
- [Alex](https://transloadit.com/about/#alex) Improved the design of the statusbar for when upload is failed. <br />

## In Progress

- As mentioned Resumability in RN doesn't work yet after a crash, and to fix this Ife is trying implement tus fingerprint storing in RN (as LocalStorage isn't available there). He'll first finish support for Node.js https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73/files then add [React Native support for tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client#react-native-support)
- Artur is working on making our RN example better to look at, showcasing a real progress bars, nice buttons for pauze & resumes, as well as a first iteration on file previews. He'll also be pushing out a release with recent fixes, and give Evgenia's early work smooth landing
- Renée is writing tests to accomodate the change for [better progress reporting](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1376) and starting on Transloadit Assembly Cancellation
- Evgenia is working on the dashboard, improving how file previews are justified, as well as browser compatibility testing
- [Alex Kolodo](https://github.com/alexkolodko) (yes, that is indeed a different [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) :smile:) has been trying out some sketches for an iteration on our logo:
- We're also looking at a potentially [big problem](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146) when using tus-js-client inside React Native for big files, stay tuned!

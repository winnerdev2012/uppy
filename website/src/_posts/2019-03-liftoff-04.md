## Done

We haven't even hit April 1 yet and the 'Done' section of the project dashboard is already getting plenty of love! Today, [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) finished designing a specialized header for visitors of Uppy.io and [Tus.io](https://tus.io) to inform them about the discount on [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) services they can receive :wink:

[Adbel](https://github.com/Kiloreux) started a dialogue with the team regarding [Docker secrets](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/138) relating to one of our current [open issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1295). He decided that the best course of action was to follow the Kubernetes [best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#best-practices) and add a `Secret` resource to contain the environment variables.

## In Progress

One of the most exciting updates in terms of progress today was also contributed by Alex with his impressive pre-alpha sketch of a new homepage for Uppy. Despite only being a work in progress, the entire team has been overjoyed with how it's turning out! Take a look for yourself:

Taking a deeper look into some of the effort the team is putting in, the [Uppy repo](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pulls) shows that [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) [has been focused on fixing hanging Instagram files uploaded through Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1274/files).

Additionally, our content team's own [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo) has been hard at work updating and refining the Uppy examples, with the [first in the pipeline being Node.js and Flask](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389) related. 

And that's day 4 complete! Catch up with us tomorrow, as we take this thing into our first weekend of the 30 Days to Liftoff! And of course, if you want to keep yourself constantly updated, feel free to subscribe to our [RSS feed](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) :smile:

Six days remain in our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge. There's not long left until our planned **Uppy 1.0 release on April 25** release so let's take a look at how close we are to reaching our goal!

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) has made some great progress on improving the [drag to upload state](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440) for the Uppy Dashboard in a variety of browsers. Currently more MIME types are being added to give file previews their own unique icons.

- [Alex's](https://github.com/nqst) [design facelift](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1452) was completed after some testing by [Artur](https://github.com/arturi). Take a look at some of the improvements below:

- [Tim](https://github.com/tim-kos) will be spending today thoroughly testing Uppy in preparation for the upcoming release

- Uppy 0.30.5 will be released by [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) today. One of the main changes here is our name change from the `serverUrl` property to `companionUrl`. A simple check if being added, and we will notify users that it has been depreceated so they have ample time to make the change within their code.

- [React Native](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) was merged into our Uppy master branch on Github. We're confident that our initial release will be useful for those who need a basic implementation. Of course our React Native development will continue, so stay tuned for that. 

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) and [Marius](https://github.com/Acconut) continue their work on large file issue related to React Native and tus-js-client. They are considering to add a tus option to allow React Native developers to pass their own custom file picker module. This would add some flexibility for developers and prevent us from bloating tus-js-client.

- Error reporting for the Transloadit plugin will be worked on by [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop). This will ensure users are notified of various issues while utilising the API, notably connection issues.

Thus ends Day 24. We're all on a well deserved break for Good Friday tomorrow and we hope you will be too! Check us out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) and on [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) as we edge closer to **Uppy 1.0** :dog:

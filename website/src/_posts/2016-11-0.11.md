Hey, what’s up!

In October we worked on Uppy 0.11, that included: grand architecture write up and discussions, bringing in a friendly person to look at what we’ve been up to, Redux experiments, updated Dashboard UI and website example,

## More research and experiments

Here’s what we’ve been up to:

- Written up an [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md) document describing our architecture and APIs.
- Invited author of [Choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo), Yoshua Wuyts to take a look at the state of things in Uppy, and he came up with a proposal for some changes, that we’ll be considering in the next releases.
- Experimented with using Redux.

## Dashboard: example features, StatusBar and updated UI

**Dashboard example** [on our website](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/) now features several options:

- Switch between “inline” and “modal dialog / popup” mode.
- Toggle `autoProceed` option that starts uploads automatically, without waiting for the click on “upload” button.
- Enable/disable acquire plugins, like Google Drive and Webcam.

**StatusBar** is a bar (yes) that appears on the bottom of the Dashboard and unifies progress with pause/resume buttons.

**Dashboard UI** has undergone minor improvements, like: new “drag files here” icon and tagline. The text before “acquire” icons on the top — Local Disk, Google Drive, Webcam — has been removed (it used to say “Import files from:”). New “remove file” icons. You know, small things, big difference.

## HTTPS

We’ve upgraded both [uppy.io](http://uppy.io/) and [tus.io](http://tus.io/) to support https with Let’s Encrypt, so now Webcam example works, secure uploads work, and all is well.

## And more

- We’ve renamed FormTag plugin to FileInput and made it pretty be default, with an option to just show the default browser “choose file” if you wish.
- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/126) with `autoProceed: true` duplicating uploads.
- Refactored Dashboard to only keep active acquire panel in DOM.
- Added PersistentState plugin that saves state to localStorage — useful for development.
- [Grand refactor of Uppy Server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/131) with dynamic controllers.
- Webcam stream no longer flashed when state is updated.

We are proud to present Uppy `0.20`. This one focuses on React and Redux DevTools support, adding storage expirations to `RestoreFiles` (The Golden Retriever) and upload retries. Enjoy!

## Redux DevTools

Uppy now has a new plugin, `ReduxDevTools`, which adds debug support for Redux DevTools and allows you to time travel like a maniac while debugging Uppy:

<figure class="wide"><video alt="Demo video showing Uppy with Redux Dev Tools and time traveling" controls autoplay><source src="/images/blog/0.20/uppy-reduxdevtools.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag, you can <a href="/images/blog/0.20/uppy-reduxdevtools.mp4">download the video</a> to watch it.</video></figure>

Try it:

```js
const ReduxDevTools = require('uppy/lib/plugins/ReduxDevTools')
uppy.use(ReduxDevTools)
```

And then [activate the browser extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).

See [#373](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/373) for details and discussion.

## Retries

We’ve added “retry UI” to the `Dashboard`, so if some of your uploads fails, and automated retries by Tus plugin also fail (maybe the network is down or the endpoint is unresponsive), you’ll see this:

<img alt="Uppy Dashboard retry UI with individual retry buttons and “retry all”" src="/images/blog/0.20/retry.jpg">

From here it’s easy to retry individual uploads or all at once. This feature currenty works best with `Tus10` plugin, with some basic `XHRUpload` support, but we’ll improve on the latter in the future releases.

## Re-designed Drag and Drop plugin

The old trustly `DragDrop` plugin has been re-designed by [@arturi](https://github.com/arturi) and [@nqst](http://zaytsev.io):

- Fresh simple design, arrow icon, white background;
- New options: `width` and `height` (both `100%` by default to fill the entire container space);
- `note` option, like in the `Dashboard` to add info about restrictions or anything else you would like your users to know;

**[Check it out](https://uppy.io/examples/dragdrop/)**

```js
uppy.use(DragDrop, { target: 'body', width: '600px', height: '300px', 'Videos only, up to 100 MB' })
```

## The Golden Retriever cleans up after itself

## Misc good stuff

- have some way to configure content-disposition for uploads
- this
- and that

## Full Changelog

Here is the full list of changes for version `0.20.0` (and patch `0.19.1`):

- core: retry/error when upload can’t start or fails (offline, connection lost, wrong endpoint); add error in file progress state, UI, question mark button (#307 / @arturi)
- core: support for retry in Tus plugin (#307 / @arturi)
- core: support for retry in XHRUpload plugin (#307 / @arturi)
- core: Add support for Redux DevTools via a plugin (#373 / @arturi)
- core: improve and merge the React PR (#170 / @goto-bus-stop, @arturi)
- core: improve core.log method, add timestamps (#372 / @arturi)
- dragdrop: redesign, add note, width/height options, arrow icon (#374 / @arturi)

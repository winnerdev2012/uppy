Hi! You're reading our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge about the **launch of Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. Here's our mission briefing.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) addressed all of [Marius](https://github.com/Acconut)' feedback towards [having React Native compatible fingerprinting](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73) in tus-js-client.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) had a call where they discussed Alex’s design improvements, and Alex' [Design Facelift PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1442) is now ready for review & merge :tada:

- Artur iterated on [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo)'s [XHR backend examples](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389)

- Ife, Artur, Alex and Marius are chasing down an issue where appending form fields is [causing 423 responses from tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd/issues/259). Marius pushed out a number of fixes already as a result, as well as a new release of tus-js-client (1.7.1)

- Artur and [Kevin](https://github.com/tim-kos) paired on creating a new structure for [Locale Packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443). The `en_US` locale is now generated from whatever strings where used in Uppy's Plugins, and other languages can use it as a reference. There will also be reporting on unused strings.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues to charge at fixing Drag & Drop issues, and [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) at making the Robodog Dashboard work inline (as well as a popup).

Hope you'll have a great weekend and see you on Monday! Keep tabs on [@uppy_io](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) for more Uppy updates.

Hi! Hope y'all have had great holidays! üéÑ Which reminds us, we still have a gift for you ‚Äì and we even wrapped it in a package (npm) for you. Look inside and you'll find that Uppy 0.14 is here! 

"But wait", you might ask, "where is the 0.13 release that we have been waiting for?" 

Well, let's just say we are superstitious like that. You won't see us coding under any ladders either! Add to that the fact that we were also in the middle of the holiday season, we decided to call 0.13 ‚ÄòThe Release That Wasn‚Äôt‚Äô and just skip it. Our latest release is dead, long live our latest release!

Let's take a look at what Uppy 0.14 has in store for you.

## Major Uppy Server Updates

**Express.js**
We have switched to Express from Koa. Not only is it more widely adopted and supported, but it also has a larger community and better maintained packages. More than enough reason for us, so we went for it!

**Pluggable or standalone**
Uppy Server can now be plugged into your existing Express/Koa server app, but you can also still run it as a standalone server. [See here](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server#run-as-standalone-server) for further instructions.

**Smooth authentication**
It used to be the case that when you clicked that stylish ‚Äúauthenticate‚Äù [with Google Drive] button, you were taken away from the page, and things tended to get lost. That has now all been made silky smooth: upon clicking the button, a fresh tab will now open in your browser, which will take you to the authentication page  ‚Äì be it on Google Drive, Dropbox, or somewhere else. When you are done, this tab is automagically closed again, and you are back where you were, authenticated, with all your remote files at hand.

**Dropbox plugin**
Dropbox support made it into Uppy this release! üéâ Ife rocks like that. (A shoutout here as well to Harry for the initial work on Uppy Server and the Google Drive plugin!) Why don't you [give it a try](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/)!

What‚Äôs more, the client-side code of Google Drive and Dropbox plugins is slowly being refactored into a generic provider view that can be shared among all services.

## Dashboard

**Responsive UI and more icons**
The Dashboard now adapts itself to screen sizes big and small. That includes `inline` mode, where you can set `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` in options, like so:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  maxWidth: 300,
  maxHeight: 350,
  inline: true,
  target: '#myUploadContainer'
})
```

~~Or let it stretch to the size of the container.~~

We are not using media queries here, but have instead added a `UppyDashboard--wide` CSS class, which allows for more flexibility ‚Äî your file uploading widget can be tiny even if the screen is large.

When there is little space available, the file grid view that you have become used to, will turn into a new compact list view.

<figure class="wide"><img src="/images/blog/0.14/dashboard-grid-list.jpg"></figure>

We are also adding more file type icons and trying to be smarter about detecting them. We have new icons for video, audio, text, and PDF for you to enjoy.

**Total / uploaded sizes**
Total and uploaded sizes have been added to the StatusBar, allowing you and your users to keep track of all those bits and bytes.

## Per plugin locale settings

We have moved locale settings to plugins from core. This means you can now do things like:

```js
uppy.use(DragDrop, {target: '.drop', locale: {
  strings: {
    chooseFile: 'Valitse tiedoston',
    orDragDrop: 'tai siirt√§√§ t√§nne',
  }
}})
```

And just like that, your Drag&Drop plugin now speaks Finnish! *Loistava!* By default, each UI plugin ships with an English locale to which it will fall back in case some strings are missing from your translation. This feature is a work in progress, we are still trying to find the sweet spot between bundling a whole bunch of strings that might not get used and making you choose or set language for each separate UI plugin. We'd love to hear what you think.

## Misc

- [yo-yoify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yoify) has been added to our build setup in order to solve a [Function.caller / strict mode issue](https://github.com/shama/bel#note) and to make the app faster/smaller by transforming template strings into pure and fast document calls.
- By the way, Uppy‚Äôs UI DOM is powered by [yo-yo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yo). We like yo-yo for its simplicity, speed and small size, but sometimes there are issues, one of them being the lack of wide adoption. We are looking at [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), but are also quite excited about [Nanocomponent](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent).
- We have fixed progress events that were not being properly sent from Uppy Server. As it turns out, this occurred because server uploads were happening too fast, before the client was actually able to connect to the server. :scream: Guess that‚Äôs a good problem to have solved!
- We have recently added Uppy to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy) and we were very pleased with the warm welcome we received. We even made it to their front page a few days later. Let's hope it will help to get more people excited about Uppy! :smile:

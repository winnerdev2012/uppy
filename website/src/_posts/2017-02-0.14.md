Hi! Hope ya all‚Äôve had great holidays üéÑ We have a gift for you too, and it‚Äôs wrapped in a package (npm). Uppy 0.14 is here! ‚ÄòBut wait‚Äô, you might ask, ‚Äòwhere is the 0.13 that we‚Äôve been waiting for‚Äô? Well, we are superstitious like that, plus it was holiday time. So we‚Äôve decided to call 0.13 ‚ÄòThe Release That Wasn‚Äôt‚Äô and not release it.

## Major Uppy Server updates

**Express.js**
We‚Äôve switched to Express from Koa. It‚Äôs more widely adopted and supported, has larger community and better maintained packages, so we went for it.

**Pluggable or standalone**
Uppy Server can now be plugged into your existing Express/Koa server app or run standalone.

**Smooth authentication**
It used to be that when you clicked that stylish ‚Äúauthenticate‚Äù [with Google Drive] button, you were taken away from the page, and things got lost. Now it‚Äôs all silky smooth: you are taken to with the provider, be it Google Drive, Dropbox or whatever, to authenticate in a new tab. Then said tab is magically closed, and you are back where you were, authenticated, with all your remote files at hand.

**Dropbox plugin**
Dropbox support made it into Uppy this release! üéâ Ife rocks like that. (Shoutout to Harry for the initial work on Uppy Server and Google Drive plugin!) [Try it out](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

What‚Äôs more, the client side code of Google Drive and Dropbox plugins is slowly being refactored into a generic provider view that can be shared among all services.

## Dashboard

**Responsive UI and more icons**
Dashboard now adapts itself to screen sizes big and small. That includes `inline` mode, where you can set `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` in options, like so:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  maxWidth: 300,
  maxHeight: 350,
  inline: true,
  target: '#myUploadContainer'
})
```

~~Or let it stretch to the size of the container.~~

We are not using media queries here, but instead adding a `UppyDashboard--wide` CSS class, which allows for more flexibility ‚Äî your file uploading widget can be tiny even if the screen is large.

When the available space is small, the file grid view that you are used to turns into a new compact list view.

We are also adding more file type icons and trying to get smarter about detecting them. Meet new video, audio, text, and PDF icons.

**Total / uploaded sizes**
Total and uploaded sizes have been added to the StatusBar, so you and your users can keep track of those bits and bytes.

## Per plugin locale settings

We‚Äôve moved locale settings to plugins from core. So now you can do this:

```js
uppy.use(DragDrop, {target: '.drop', locale: {
  strings: {
    chooseFile: 'Valitse tiedoston',
    orDragDrop: 'tai siirt√§√§ t√§nne',
  }
}})
```

And just like that, your Drag&Drop plugin now speaks Finnish! By default each UI plugin ships with an English locale and falls back to it if some strings are missing from your translation. This feature is a WIP, we are still trying to find the sweet spot between bundling a whole bunch of strings that might not get used and making you choose or set language per each UI plugin. Let us know what you think.

## Misc

- [yo-yoify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yoify) has been added to our build setup to solve [Function.caller / strict mode issue](https://github.com/shama/bel#note) and make the app faster/smaller by transforming template strings into pure and fast document calls.
- By the way, Uppy‚Äôs UI DOM has been and is powered by [yo-yo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yo). We like it cause it‚Äôs simple, fast and tiny, but sometimes there are issues, one of them being the lack of wide adoption. We are looking at [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), but also excited about [Nanocomponent](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent).
- We‚Äôve fixed progress events not being properly sent from Uppy Server. Turns out, its was because server uploads happened too fast, before the client was actually able to connect to the server :scream: Guess that‚Äôs a good problem to solve.

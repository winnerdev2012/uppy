## Yo-yoify For NPM-installed Uppy

In [`0.14`](http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/0.14/) we‚Äôve added `yo-yoify` transform to speed Uppy up and eliminate `Function.caller` issues. Turns out, we [forgot](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/158) about our Babel-transpiled `lib` version of Uppy that gets published to NPM üôÄ. We‚Äôve spent some time creating a standalone version of `yo-yoify` that could parse `yo-yo` template strings before Babel-transpilation, only to discover that there is a [`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify) that does precisely that, and frees us from jumping through hoops. It [had](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/9) [some](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/pull/8) [issues](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/11) that we collaborated on with a friendly [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop), who also agreed to join Uppy for a while to help us with other pressing issues. So, silver linings ‚Äî bugs sometimes lead to new friends and wonderful beginnings. We are very excited.

So, Uppy from NPM is now good to go, the issue has been resolved. Please update: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uppy. And yeah, if you use `yo-yo`, try [`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify).

## Pause & Resume Remote Uploads

Uploads via `uppy-server` and `tus`, which happen when you select files from Google Drive or Dropbox, for example, can now be paused and resumed, just like ‚Äúlocal‚Äù uploads üéâ

## Progress Throttling

While working on pausing remote uploads with `uppy-server` Ife discovered a strange bug: uppy-client would hang during the upload, and the progress would jump straight to 100% afterwards. Turns out, uploads were happening too fast, which led to progress events being sent very very often (like 300 / second), which trashed the interface rendering loop. This was solved by [adding throttling in tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/commit/9940f27b2361fd7e10ba58b09b60d82422183bbb) (thanks Marius!) and [uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/commit/936ad48e92631c45d123664900b9aabcf7a190fa) (thanks Ife!). And I will take this opportunity to thank myself for [fixing](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/1d5f4404546420442deabc94df84bd3ec0677eec) [it](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/db32c6f4fd85420532f27f04920dbaf6d126ea9b) in uppy-client too.

To prevent ‚Äújumping‚Äù progress numbers and text in StatusBar are only updated once a second. Plus, we‚Äôve switched to [`prettier-bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-bytes) that adds some nice number rounding. Smooth!

TL;DR Uppy is very fast at uploading!

## Informer‚Äôs got colors

Informer now changes its looks depending on the `type` argument:

```js
// (`'informer'`, `text`, `type`, `duration`)
uppy.emit('informer', 'Connected!', 'success', 3000)
```

<img src="/images/blog/0.15/informer.png">

Supports the following `type`s: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, all with their own colors!

## Some other things

- Multipart now treats all 2xx responses as successful and returns xhr object in `core:upload-success` event callback.
- That progress circle that use see on each file in Dashboard has been improved on the inside: precise `circleLength` and `stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset` calculation.
- Uppy-server returns uploaded file urls and sizes for remote uploads (from Google Drive & Dropbox).
- Provider plugins now have a loading screen and error screen, logout link. Breadcrumbs are working again.

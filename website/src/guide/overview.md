Uppy is (going to be) an uploader written in ES6 JavaScript with a plugin-based architecture, making it very extensible. Out of the box it supports tapping into Dropbox, Instagram, Local files. It has support for resumable file uploads via tus.io, and adding encoding backends.

Uppy is brought to you by the people behind Transloadit and as such has first class support for adding their uploading and encoding backend, but this is opt-in.

Drag and drop, webcam, basic file manipulation (adding metadata, for example) and uploading via tus-resumable uploads or XHR/Multipart are all possible using just the Uppy client module.

However, if you add [Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/packages/@uppy/companion) to the mix, your users will be able to select files from remote sources, such as Instagram, Google Drive and Dropbox, bypassing the client (so a 5 GB video isn’t eating into your users’ data plans), and then uploaded to the final destination. Files are removed from Companion after an upload is complete, or after a reasonable timeout. Access tokens also don’t stick around for long, for security reasons.

Companion handles the server-to-server communication between your server and file storage providers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, etc. Note that you can **not** upload files **to** Companion, it just handles the third party integrations.

## Supported providers

As of now, Companion is integrated to work with:

- Google Drive (name `drive`) - [Set up instructions](/docs/google-drive/#Setting-Up)
- Dropbox (name `dropbox`) - [Set up instructions](/docs/dropbox/#Setting-Up)
- Box (name `box`) - [Set up instructions](/docs/box/#Setting-Up)
- Instagram (name `instagram`)
- Facebook (name `facebook`)
- OneDrive (name `onedrive`)
- Remote URLs (name `url`)
- Amazon S3 (name `s3`)

## Installation

Install from NPM:

```bash
npm install @uppy/companion
```

If you don't have a Node.js project with a `package.json` you might want to install/run Companion globally like so: `[sudo] npm install -g @uppy/companion@1.x`.

### Prerequisite

Since v2, you now need to be running `node.js >= v10.20.1` to use Companion. Please see [Migrating v1 to v2](#Migrating-v1-to-v2)

Unfortunately, Windows is not a supported platform right now. It may work, and we're happy to accept improvements in this area, but we can't provide assistance.

## Usage

Companion may either be used as a pluggable express app, which you plug into your already existing server, or it may simply be run as a standalone server:

### Plugging into an already existing server

To plug Companion into an existing server, call its `.app` method, passing in an [options](#Options) object as a parameter.

```javascript

var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var session = require('express-session')
var companion = require('@uppy/companion')

var app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(session({secret: 'some secrety secret'}))
...
// be sure to place this anywhere after app.use(bodyParser.json()) and app.use(session({...})
const options = {
  providerOptions: {
    drive: {
      key: 'GOOGLE_DRIVE_KEY',
      secret: 'GOOGLE_DRIVE_SECRET'
    }
  },
  server: {
    host: 'localhost:3020',
    protocol: 'http',
  },
  filePath: '/path/to/folder/'
}

app.use(companion.app(options))

```

please be sure to allow the following HTTP methods in your server like so:

```javascript
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT");
```

See [Options](#Options) for valid configuration options.

To use WebSockets for realtime upload progress, you can call the `socket` method, like so:

```javascript
...
var server = app.listen(PORT)

companion.socket(server, options)
```

This takes your `server` instance and your Uppy [Options](#Options) as parameters.

### Running as a standalone server

> Please ensure that the required environment variables are set before running/using Companion as a standalone server. See [Configure Standalone](#Configuring-a-standalone-server) for the variables required.

Set environment variables first:

```bash
export COMPANION_SECRET="shh!Issa Secret!"
export COMPANION_DOMAIN="YOUR SERVER DOMAIN"
export COMPANION_DATADIR="PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/DIRECTORY"
```

And then run:

```bash
companion
```

You can also pass in the path to your JSON config file, like so:

```bash
companion --config /path/to/uppyconf.json
```

Please see [Options](#Options) for possible options.

#### Configuring a standalone server

  debug: true
}
```

1. **filePath(required)** - Full path to the directory to which provider files would be downloaded temporarily.

2. **redisUrl(optional)** - URL to running Redis server. If this is set, the state of uploads would be stored temporarily. This helps for resumed uploads after a browser crash from the client. The stored upload would be sent back to the client on reconnection.

3. **redisOptions(optional)** - An object of [options supported by redis client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis#options-object-properties). This option can be used in place of `redisUrl`.

4. **providerOptions(optional)** - An object containing credentials (`key` and `secret`) for each provider you would like to enable. Please see [the list of supported providers](#Supported-providers).

5. **server(optional)** - An object with details, mainly used to carry out oauth authentication from any of the enabled providers above. Though it is optional, it is required if you would be enabling any of the supported providers. The following are the server options you may set:

  - protocol - `http | https`
  - host(required) - your server host (e.g localhost:3020, mydomain.com)
  - path - the server path to where the Uppy app is sitting (e.g if Companion is at `mydomain.com/companion`, then the path would be `/companion`).
  - oauthDomain - if you have multiple instances of Companion with different (and perhaps dynamic) subdomains, you can set a master domain (e.g `sub1.mydomain.com`) to handle your oauth authentication for you. This would then redirect to the slave subdomain with the required credentials on completion.
  - validHosts - if you are setting a master `oauthDomain`, you need to set a list of valid hosts, so the master oauth handler can validate the host of the Uppy instance requesting the authentication. This is basically a list of valid domains running your Companion instances. The list may also contain regex patterns. e.g `['sub2.mydomain.com', 'sub3.mydomain.com', '(\\w+).mydomain.com']`
  - implicitPath - if the URL path to your Companion server is set in your NGINX server (or any other Http server) instead of your express app, then you need to set this path as `implicitPath`. So if your Companion URL is `mydomain.com/mypath/companion`. Where the path `/mypath` is defined in your NGINX server, while `/companion` is set in your express app. Then you need to set the option `implicitPath` to `/mypath`, and set the `path` option to `/companion`.

6. **sendSelfEndpoint(optional)** - This is basically the same as the `server.host + server.path` attributes. The major reason for this attribute is that, when set, it adds the value as the `i-am` header of every request response.

7. **customProviders(optional)** - This option enables you to add custom providers along with the already supported providers. See [Adding Custom Providers](#Adding-custom-providers) for more information.

8. **uploadUrls(optional)** - An array of URLs (full paths). If specified, Companion will only accept uploads to these URLs (useful when you want to make sure a Companion instance is only allowed to upload to your servers, for example).

9. **secret(required)** - A secret string which Companion uses to generate authorization tokens.

10. **debug(optional)** - A boolean flag to tell Companion whether or not to log useful debug information while running.

### Provider Redirect URIs

When generating your provider API keys on their corresponding developer platforms (e.g [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)), you'd need to provide a `redirect URI` for the OAuth authorization process. In general the redirect URI for each provider takes the format:

`http(s)://$YOUR_COMPANION_HOST_NAME/$PROVIDER_NAME/redirect`

For example, if your Companion server is hosted on `https://my.companion.server.com`, then the redirect URI you would supply for your OneDrive provider would be:

`https://my.companion.server.com/onedrive/redirect`

Please see [Supported Providers](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Supported-providers) for a list of all Providers and their corresponding names.

### S3 options

Companion comes with signature endpoints for AWS S3. These can be used by the Uppy client to sign requests to upload files directly to S3, without exposing secret S3 keys in the browser. Companion also supports uploading files from providers like Dropbox and Instagram directly into S3.

The S3 features can be configured using the `providerOptions.s3` property.

#### `providerOptions.s3.key`

The S3 access key ID. The standalone Companion server populates this with the value of the `COMPANION_AWS_KEY` environment variable by default.

#### `providerOptions.s3.secret`

The S3 secret access key. The standalone Companion server populates this with the value of the `COMPANION_AWS_SECRET` environment variable by default.

#### `providerOptions.s3.bucket`

The name of the bucket to store uploaded files in. The standalone Companion server populates this with the value of the `COMPANION_AWS_BUCKET` environment variable by default.

#### `providerOptions.s3.region`

The datacenter region where the target bucket is located. The standalone Companion server populates this with the value of the `COMPANION_AWS_REGION` environment variable by default.

#### `providerOptions.s3.awsClientOptions`

You can supply any [S3 option supported by the AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#constructor-property) in the `providerOptions.s3.awsClientOptions` object, _except for_ the below:

- `accessKeyId`. Instead, use the `providerOptions.s3.key` property. This is to make configuration names consistent between different Companion features.
- `secretAccessKey`. Instead, use the `providerOptions.s3.secret` property. This is to make configuration names consistent between different Companion features.

Be aware that some options may cause wrong behaviour if they conflict with Companion's assumptions. If you find that a particular option does not work as expected, please [open an issue on the Uppy repository](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/new) so we can document it here.

#### `providerOptions.s3.getKey(req, filename, metadata)`

Get the key name for a file. The key is the file path to which the file will be uploaded in your bucket. This option should be a function receiving three arguments:
- `req`, the HTTP request, for _regular_ S3 uploads using the `@uppy/aws-s3` plugin. This parameter is _not_ available for multipart uploads using the `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` plugin;
- `filename`, the original name of the uploaded file;
- `metadata`, user-provided metadata for the file. See the [`@uppy/aws-s3`](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3/#metaFields) docs. Currently, the `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` plugin unconditionally sends all metadata fields, so all of them are available here.

This function should return a string `key`. The `req` parameter can be used to upload to a user-specific folder in your bucket, for example:

```js
app.use(authenticationMiddleware)
app.use(uppy.app({
  providerOptions: {
    s3: {
      getKey: (req, filename, metadata) => `${req.user.id}/${filename}`,
      /* auth options */
    }
  }
}))
```

The default implementation returns the `filename`, so all files will be uploaded to the root of the bucket as their original file name.
```js
({
  getKey: (req, filename, metadata) => filename
})
```

### Running in Kubernetes

We have [a detailed guide on running Companion in Kubernetes](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/packages/%40uppy/companion/KUBERNETES.md) for you, that’s how we currently run our example server at <https://companion.uppy.io>.

### Adding custom providers

As of now, Companion supports the [providers listed here](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Supported-providers) out of the box, but you may also choose to add your own custom providers. You can do this by passing the `customProviders` option when calling the Uppy `app` method. The custom provider is expected to support Oauth 1 or 2 for authentication/authorization.

```javascript
let options = {
    customProviders: {
        myprovidername: {
            config: {
                authorize_url: "https://mywebsite.com/authorize",
                access_url: "https://mywebsite.com/token",
                oauth: 2,
                key: "***",
                secret: "***",
                scope: ["read", "write"]
            },
            module: require('/path/to/provider/module')
        }
    }
}

uppy.app(options)
```

The `customProviders` option should be an object containing each custom provider. Each custom provider would, in turn, be an object with two keys, `config` and `module`. The `config` option would contain Oauth API settings, while the `module` would point to the provider module.

To work well with Companion, the **Module** must be a class with the following methods.

1. `list (options, done)` - lists JSON data of user files (e.g. list of all the files in a particular directory).
  - `options` - is an object containing the following attributes
    - token - authorization token (retrieved from oauth process) to send along with your request
    - directory - the `id/name` of the directory from which data is to be retrieved. This may be ignored if it doesn't apply to your provider
    - query - expressjs query params object received by the server (just in case there is some data you need in there).
  - `done (err, data)` - the callback that should be called when the request to your provider is made. As the signature indicates, the following data should be passed along to the callback `err`, and [`data`](#list-data).
2. `download (options, onData)` - downloads a particular file from the provider.
  - `options` - is an object containing the following attributes:
    - token - authorization token (retrieved from oauth process) to send along with your request.
    - id - ID of the file being downloaded.
    - query - expressjs query params object received by the server (just in case there is some data you need in there).
  - `onData (err, chunk)` - a callback that should be called with each data chunk received as download is happening. The `err` argument is an error that should be passed if an error occurs during download. It should be `null` if there's no error. Once the download is completed and there are no more chunks to receive, `onData` should be called with `null` values like so `onData(null, null)`
3. `size (options, done)` - returns the byte size of the file that needs to be downloaded.
  - `options` - is an object containing the following attributes:
    - token - authorization token (retrieved from oauth process) to send along with your request.
    - id - ID of the file being downloaded.
  - `done (err, size)` - the callback that should be called after the request to your provider is completed. As the signature indicates, the following data should be passed along to the callback `err`, and `size` (number).

The class must also have an `authProvider` string (lowercased) field which typically indicates the name of the provider (e.g "dropbox").

#### list data

```js
{
  // username or email of the user whose provider account is being accessed
  username: 'johndoe',
  // list of files and folders in the directory. An item is considered a folder
  //  if it mainly exists as a collection to contain sub-items
  items: [
    {
      // boolean value of whether or NOT it's a folder
      isFolder: false,
      // icon image URL
      icon: 'https://random-api.url.com/fileicon.jpg',
      // name of the item
      name: 'myfile.jpg',
      // the mime type of the item. Only relevant if the item is NOT a folder
      mimeType: 'image/jpg',
      // the id (in string) of the item
      id: 'uniqueitemid',
      // thumbnail image URL. Only relevant if the item is NOT a folder
      thumbnail: 'https://random-api.url.com/filethumbnail.jpg',
      // for folders this is typically the value that will be passed as "directory" in the list(...) method.
      // For files, this is the value that will be passed as id in the download(...) method.
      requestPath: 'file-or-folder-requestpath',
      // datetime string (in ISO 8601 format) of when this item was last modified
      modifiedDate: '2020-06-29T19:59:58Z',
      // the size in bytes of the item. Only relevent if the item is NOT a folder
      size: 278940,
      custom: {
        // an object that may contain some more custom fields that you may need to send to the client. Only add this object if you have a need for it.
        customData1: 'the value',
        customData2: 'the value',
      },
      // more items here
    }
  ]
  // if the "items" list is paginated, this is the request path needed to fetch the next page.
  nextPagePath: 'directory-name?cursor=cursor-to-next-page'
}
```

## Migrating v1 to v2

### Prerequisite

Since v2, you now need to be running `node.js >= v10.20.1` to use Companion.

### ProviderOptions

In v2 the `google` and `microsoft` [providerOptions](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Options) have been changed to `drive` and `onedrive` respectively.

### OAuth Redirect URIs

On your Providers' respective developer platforms, the OAuth redirect URIs that you should supply has now changed from:

`http(s)://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/connect/$AUTH_PROVIDER/callback` in v1

to:

`http(s)://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/$PROVIDER_NAME/redirect` in v2

#### New Redirect URIs

<div class="table-responsive">

| Provider | New Redirect URI
|-|-|
| Dropbox | `https://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/dropbox/redirect` |
| Google Drive | `https://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/drive/redirect` |
| OneDrive | `https://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/onedrive/redirect` |
| Box | `https://$YOUR_COMPANION_HOST_NAME/box/redirect` |
| Facebook | `https://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/facebook/redirect` |
| Instagram | `https://$COMPANION_HOST_NAME/instagram/redirect` |

</div>

## Development

1\. To set up Companion for local development, please clone the Uppy repo and install, like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/transloadit/uppy && cd uppy && npm install
```

2\. Configure your environment variables by copying the `env.example.sh` file to `env.sh` and edit it to its correct values.

```bash
cp env.example.sh env.sh
$EDITOR env.sh
```

3\. To start the server, run:

```bash
npm run start:companion
```

This would get the Companion instance running on `http://localhost:3020`. It uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) so it will automatically restart when files are changed.

## Live example

An example server is running at <https://companion.uppy.io>, which is deployed with [Kubernetes](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/packages/%40uppy/companion/KUBERNETES.md)


## How the Authentication and Token mechanism works

This section describes how Authentication works between Companion and Providers. While this behaviour is the same for all Providers (Dropbox, Instagram, Google Drive, etc.), we are going to be referring to Dropbox in place of any Provider throughout this section.

The following steps describe the actions that take place when a user Authenticates and Uploads from Dropbox through Companion:

- The visitor to a website with Uppy clicks "Connect to Dropbox".
- Uppy sends a request to Companion, which in turn sends an OAuth request to Dropbox (Requires that OAuth credentials from Dropbox have been added to Companion).
- Dropbox asks the visitor to log in, and whether the Website should be allowed to access your files
- If the visitor agrees, Companion will receive a token from Dropbox, with which we can temporarily download files.
- Companion encrypts the token with a secret key and sends the encrypted token to Uppy (client)
- Every time the visitor clicks on a folder in Uppy, it asks Companion for the new list of files, with this question, the token (still encrypted by Companion) is sent along.
- Companion decrypts the token, requests the list of files from Dropbox and sends it to Uppy.
- When a file is selected for upload, Companion receives the token again according to this procedure, decrypts it again, and thereby downloads the file from Dropbox.
- As the bytes arrive, Companion uploads the bytes to the final destination (depending on the configuration: Apache, a Tus server, S3 bucket, etc).
- Companion reports progress to Uppy, as if it were a local upload.
- Completed!

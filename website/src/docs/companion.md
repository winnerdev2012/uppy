Drag and drop, webcam, basic file manipulation (adding metadata, for example) and uploading via tus-resumable uploads or XHR/Multipart are all possible using just the Uppy client module.

However, if you add [Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/packages/@uppy/companion) to the mix, your users will be able to select files from remote sources, such as Instagram, Google Drive and Dropbox, bypassing the client (so a 5 GB video isn’t eating into your users’ data plans), and then uploaded to the final destination. Files are removed from Companion after an upload is complete, or after a reasonable timeout. Access tokens also don’t stick around for long, for security reasons.

Companion handles the server-to-server communication between your server and file storage providers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, etc. Note that you can **not** upload files **to** Companion, it just handles the third party integrations.

## Supported providers

As of now, Companion is integrated to work with:

- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Instagram
- Remote URLs
- Amazon S3

## Installation

Install from NPM:

```bash
npm install @uppy/companion
```

If you don't have a Node.js project with a `package.json` you might want to install/run Companion globally like so: `[sudo] npm install -g @uppy/companion@0.30.0`.

Unfortunately, Windows is not a supported platform right now. It may work, and we're happy to accept improvements in this area, but we can't provide assistance.

## Usage

Companion may either be used as a pluggable express app, which you plug into your already existing server, or it may simply be run as a standalone server:

### Plugging into an already existing server

To plug Companion into an existing server, call its `.app` method, passing in an [options](#Options) object as a parameter.

```javascript

var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var session = require('express-session')
var companion = require('@uppy/companion')

var app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(session({secret: 'some secrety secret'}))
...
// be sure to place this anywhere after app.use(bodyParser.json()) and app.use(session({...})
const options = {
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      key: 'GOOGLE_KEY',
      secret: 'GOOGLE_SECRET'
    }
  },
  server: {
    host: 'localhost:3020',
    protocol: 'http',
  },
  filePath: '/path/to/folder/'
}

app.use(companion.app(options))

```

please be sure to allow the following HTTP methods in your server like so:

```javascript
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT");
```

See [Options](#Options) for valid configuration options.

To use WebSockets for realtime upload progress, you can call the `socket` method, like so:

```javascript
...
var server = app.listen(PORT)

companion.socket(server, options)
```

This takes your `server` instance and your Uppy [Options](#Options) as parameters.

### Running as a standalone server

> Please ensure that the required environment variables are set before running/using Companion as a standalone server. See [Configure Standalone](#Configure-Standalone) for the variables required.

Set environment variables first:

```bash
export COMPANION_SECRET="shh!Issa Secret!"
export COMPANION_DOMAIN="YOUR SERVER DOMAIN"
export COMPANION_DATADIR="PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/DIRECTORY"
```

And then run:

```bash
companion
```

You can also pass in the path to your JSON config file, like so:

```bash
companion --config /path/to/uppyconf.json
```

Please see [Options](#Options) for possible options.

#### Configuring a standalone server

### Options

```javascript
{
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      key: "***",
      secret: "***"
    },
    dropbox: {
      key: "***",
      secret: "***"
    },
    instagram: {
      key: "***",
      secret: "***"
    },
    s3: {
      getKey: (req, filename) => filename,
      key: "***",
      secret: "***",
      bucket: "bucket-name",
      region: "us-east-1"
    }
  },
  server: {
    host: "localhost:3020", // or yourdomain.com
    protocol: "http"
  },
  filePath: "path/to/download/folder",
  sendSelfEndpoint: "localhost:3020",
  secret: 'mysecret',
  uploadUrls: ['https://myuploadurl.com', 'http://myuploadurl2.com']
  debug: true
}
```

1. **filePath(required)** - Full path to the directory to which provider files would be downloaded temporarily.

2. **redisUrl(optional)** - URL to running Redis server. If this is set, the state of uploads would be stored temporarily. This helps for resumed uploads after a browser crash from the client. The stored upload would be sent back to the client on reconnection.

3. **providerOptions(optional)** - An object containing credentials (`key` and `secret`) for each provider you would like to enable. Please see [the list of supported providers](#Supported-Providers).

4. **server(optional)** - An object with details, mainly used to carry out oauth authentication from any of the enabled providers above. Though it is optional, it is required if you would be enabling any of the supported providers. The following are the server options you may set:

  - protocol - `http | https`
  - host(required) - your server host (e.g localhost:3020, mydomain.com)
  - path - the server path to where the Uppy app is sitting (e.g if Companion is at `mydomain.com/uppy`, then the path would be `/uppy`).
  - oauthDomain - if you have multiple instances of Companion with different (and perhaps dynamic) subdomains, you can set a master domain (e.g `sub1.mydomain.com`) to handle your oauth authentication for you. This would then redirect to the slave subdomain with the required credentials on completion.
  - validHosts - if you are setting a master `oauthDomain`, you need to set a list of valid hosts, so the master oauth handler can validate the host of the Uppy instance requesting the authentication. This is basically a list of valid domains running your Companion instances. The list may also contain regex patterns. e.g `['sub2.mydomain.com', 'sub3.mydomain.com', '(\\w+).mydomain.com']`

5. **sendSelfEndpoint(optional)** - This is basically the same as the `server.host + server.path` attributes. The major reason for this attribute is that, when set, it adds the value as the `i-am` header of every request response.

6. **customProviders(optional)** - This option enables you to add custom providers along with the already supported providers. See [Adding Custom Providers](#Adding-Custom-Providers) for more information.

7. **uploadUrls(optional)** - An array of URLs (full paths). If specified, Companion will only accept uploads to these URLs (useful when you want to make sure a Companion instance is only allowed to upload to your servers, for example).

8. **secret(required)** - A secret string which Companion uses to generate authorization tokens.

9. **debug(optional)** - A boolean flag to tell Companion whether or not to log useful debug information while running.

### S3 options

The S3 uploader has some options in addition to the ones necessary for authentication.

#### `s3.getKey(req, filename)`

Get the key name for a file. The key is the file path to which the file will be uploaded in your bucket. This option should be a function receiving two arguments: `req`, the HTTP request, and the original `filename` of the uploaded file. It should return a string `key`. The `req` parameter can be used to upload to a user-specific folder in your bucket, for example:

```js
app.use(authenticationMiddleware)
app.use(uppy.app({
  s3: {
    getKey: (req, filename) => `${req.user.id}/${filename}`,
    /* auth options */
  }
}))
```

The default value simply returns `filename`, so all files will be uploaded to the root of the bucket as their original file name.

### Running in Kubernetes

We have [a detailed guide on running Companion in Kubernetes](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/packages/%40uppy/companion/KUBERNETES.md) for you, that’s how we currently run our example server at https://companion.uppy.io.

### Adding custom providers

As of now, Companion supports **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, **Instagram**, and **URL** (remote urls) out of the box, but you may also choose to add your own custom providers. You can do this by passing the `customProviders` option when calling the Uppy `app` method. The custom provider is expected to support Oauth 1 or 2 for authentication/authorization.

```javascript
let options = {
    customProviders: {
        myprovidername: {
            config: {
                authorize_url: "https://mywebsite.com/authorize",
                access_url: "https://mywebsite.com/token",
                oauth: 2,
                key: "***",
                secret: "***",
                scope: ["read", "write"]
            },
            module: require('/path/to/provider/module')
        }
    }
}

uppy.app(options)
```

The `customProviders` option should be an object containing each custom provider. Each custom provider would, in turn, be an object with two keys, `config` and `module`. The `config` option would contain Oauth API settings, while the `module` would point to the provider module.

To work well with Companion, the **Module** must be a class with the following methods.

1. `list (options, done)` - lists JSON data of user files (e.g. list of all the files in a particular directory).
  - `options` - is an object containing the following attributes
    - token - authorization token (retrieved from oauth process) to send along with your request
    - directory - the `id/name` of the directory from which data is to be retrieved. This may be ignored if it doesn't apply to your provider
    - query - expressjs query params object received by the server (just in case there is some data you need in there).
  - `done (err, response, body)` - the callback that should be called when the request to your provider is made. As the signature indicates, the following data should be passed along to the callback `err`, `response`, and `body`.
2. `download (options, onData, onResponse)` - downloads a particular file from the provider.
  - `options` - is an object containing the following attributes:
    - token - authorization token (retrieved from oauth process) to send along with your request.
    - id - ID of the file being downloaded.
  - `onData (chunk)` - a callback that should be called with each data chunk received on download. This is useful if the size of the downloaded file can be pre-determined. This would allow for pipelined upload of the file (to the desired destination), while the download is still going on.
  - `onResponse (response)` - if the size of the downloaded file can not be pre-determined by Companion, then this callback should be called in place of the `onData` callback. This callback would be called after the download is done, and would take the downloaded data (response) as the argument.

## Development

1\. To set up Companion for local development, please clone the Uppy repo and install, like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/transloadit/uppy && cd uppy && npm install
```

2\. Configure your environment variables by copying the `env.example.sh` file to `env.sh` and edit it to its correct values.

```bash
cp env.example.sh env.sh
$EDITOR env.sh
```

3\. To start the server, run:

```bash
npm run start:companion
```

This would get the Companion instance running on `http://localhost:3020`. It uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) so it will automatically restart when files are changed.

## Live example

An example server is running at https://companion.uppy.io, which is deployed with [Kubernetes](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/packages/%40uppy/companion/KUBERNETES.md)


## How the Authentication and Token mechanism works

This section describes how Authentication works between Companion and Providers. While this behaviour is the same for all Providers (Dropbox, Instagram, Google Drive), we are going to be referring to Dropbox in place of any Provider throughout this section.

The following steps describe the actions that take place when a user Authenticates and Uploads from Dropbox through Companion:

- The visitor to a website with Uppy clicks "Connect to Dropbox".
- Uppy sends a request to Companion, which in turn sends an OAuth request to Dropbox (Requires that OAuth credentials from Dropbox have been added to Companion).
- Dropbox asks the visitor to log in, and whether the Website should be allowed to access your files
- If the visitor agrees, Companion will receive a token from Dropbox, with which we can temporarily download files.
- Companion encrypts the token with a secret key and sends the encrypted token to Uppy (client)
- Every time the visitor clicks on a folder in Uppy, it asks Companion for the new list of files, with this question, the token (still encrypted by Companion) is sent along.
- Companion decrypts the token, requests the list of files from Dropbox and sends it to Uppy.
- When a file is selected for upload, Companion receives the token again according to this procedure, decrypts it again, and thereby downloads the file from Dropbox.
- As the bytes arrive, Companion uploads the bytes to the final destination (depending on the configuration: Apache, a Tus server, S3 bucket, etc).
- Companion reports progress to Uppy, as if it were a local upload.
- Completed!

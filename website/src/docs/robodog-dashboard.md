Add the [Dashboard UI][dashboard] to your page, all wired up and ready to go! This is a basic wrapper around the [Transloadit][transloadit] and [Dashboard][dashboard] plugins. Unlike the [File Picker][file picker] API, this Dashboard is embedded directly into the page. Users can upload multiple files after another.

```html
<div id="dashboard"></div>

<script>
Robodog.dashboard('#dashboard', {
  params: {
    auth: { key: '' },
    template_id: ''
  }
})
</script>
```

This API can still be used as a modal, too, by specifying `inline: false`:

```js
Robodog.dashboard(selector, { inline: false })
```

The `Robodog.dashboard()` function returns an Uppy instance, which you can use to listen for any Uppy events.

```js
const uppy = Robodog.dashboard(selector, { ...options })
  .on('transloadit:result', (result) => {
    console.log(result)
  })
```

## Transloadit

All the options to the [Transloadit][transloadit] plugin are supported.

## Restrictions

Set rules and conditions to limit the type and/or number of files that can be selected. Restrictions are configured by the `restrictions` option.

### `restrictions.maxFileSize`

Maximum file size in bytes for each individual file.

### `restrictions.minFileSize`

Minimum file size in bytes for each individual file.

### `restrictions.maxNumberOfFiles`

The total number of files that can be selected. If this is larger than 1, the `multiple` attribute will be added to `<input type="file">` fields.

### `restrictions.minNumberOfFiles`

The minimum number of files that must be selected before the upload. The upload will fail and the form will not be submitted if fewer files were selected.

### `restrictions.allowedFileTypes`

Array of mime type wildcards `image/*`, exact mime types `image/jpeg`, or file extensions `.jpg`: `['image/*', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif']`.

If provided, the [`<input accept>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#Limiting_accepted_file_types) attribute will be added to `<input type="file">` fields, so only acceptable files can be selected in the system file dialog.

The Transloadit plugin can be used to upload files to [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) for all kinds of processing, such as transcoding video, resizing images, zipping/unzipping, [and more](https://transloadit.com/services/).

[Try it live](/examples/transloadit/)

The Transloadit plugin uses the [Tus plugin](/docs/tus) for the uploading itself.
To upload files to Transloadit directly, both the Tus and Transloadit plugins must be used:

```js
// The `resume: false` option _must_ be provided to the Tus plugin.
uppy.use(Tus, {
  resume: false
})
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
  // Transloadit plugin options
})
```

NB: It is not required to use the `Tus` plugin if [importFromUploadURLs](#importFromUploadURLs) is enabled.

## Options

### `waitForEncoding`

Whether to wait for all assemblies to complete before completing the upload.

### `waitForMetadata`

Whether to wait for metadata to be extracted from uploaded files before completing the upload.
If `waitForEncoding` is enabled, this has no effect.

### `importFromUploadURLs`

Instead of uploading to Transloadit's servers directly, allow another plugin to upload files, and then import those files into the Transloadit assembly.
Default `false`.

When enabling this option, Transloadit will *not* configure the Tus plugin to upload to Transloadit.
Instead, a separate upload plugin must be used.
Once the upload completes, the Transloadit plugin adds the uploaded file to the assembly.

For example, to upload files to an S3 bucket and then transcode them:

```js
uppy.use(AwsS3, {
  getUploadParameters (file) {
    return { /* upload parameters */ }
  }
})
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
  importFromUploadURLs: true,
  params: {
    auth: { key: /* secret */ },
    template_id: /* secret */
  }
})
```

In order for this to work, the upload plugin must assign a publically accessible `uploadURL` property to the uploaded file object.
The Tus and S3 plugins both do thisâ€”for the XHRUpload plugin, you may have to specify a custom `getUploadResponse` function.

### `params`

The assembly parameters to use for the upload.

### `signature`

An optional signature for the assembly parameters.

If a `signature` is provided, `params` should be a JSON string instead of a JavaScript object, as otherwise the generated JSON in the browser may be different from the JSON string that was used to generate the signature.

### `fields`

An object of form fields to send along to the assembly.

### `getAssemblyOptions(file)`

While `params`, `signature`, and `fields` must be determined ahead of time, the `getAssemblyOptions` allows using dynamically generated values for these options.
This way, it is possible to use different assembly parameters for different files.

A custom `getAssemblyOptions()` option should return an object or a Promise for an object with properties `{ params, signature, fields }`.
For example, to add a field with some user-provided data from the `MetaData` plugin:

```js
uppy.use(MetaData, {
  fields: [
    { id: 'caption' }
  ]
})
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
  getAssemblyOptions (file) {
    return {
      params: {
        auth: { key: 'TRANSLOADIT_AUTH_KEY_HERE' },
        template_id: 'xyz'
      },
      fields: {
        caption: file.meta.caption
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Now, the `${fields.caption}` variable will be available in the assembly template.

`getAssemblyOptions()` may also return a Promise, so it could retrieve signed assembly parameters from a server.
For example, assuming an endpoint `/transloadit-params` that responds with a JSON object with `{ params, signature }` properties:

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
  getAssemblyOptions (file) {
    return fetch('/transloadit-params').then((response) => {
      return response.json()
    })
  }
})
```

## Events

### `transloadit:assembly-created`

Fired when an assembly is created.

**Parameters**

  - `assembly` - The initial assembly status.
  - `fileIDs` - The IDs of the files that will be uploaded to this assembly.

```js
uppy.on('transloadit:assembly-created', (assembly, fileIDs) => {
  console.group('Created', assembly.assembly_id, 'for files:')
  for (const id of fileIDs) {
    console.log(uppy.getFile(id).name)
  }
  console.groupEnd()
})
```

### `transloadit:upload`

Fired when Transloadit has received an upload.

**Parameters**

  - `file` - The Transloadit file object that was uploaded.
  - `assembly` - The assembly status of the assembly the file was uploaded to.

### `transloadit:assembly-executing`

Fired when Transloadit has received all uploads, and is now executing the Assembly.

**Parameters**

 - `assembly` - The [Assembly Status](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#assembly-status-response) of the Assembly that is now executing.

### `transloadit:result`

Fired when a result came in from an assembly.

**Parameters**

  - `stepName` - The name of the assembly step that generated this result.
  - `result` - The result object from Transloadit.
    This result object contains one additional property, namely `localId`.
    This is the ID of the file in Uppy's local state, and can be used with `uppy.getFile(id)`.
  - `assembly` - The assembly status of the assembly that generated this result.

```js
uppy.on('transloadit:result', (stepName, result) => {
  const file = uppy.getFile(result.localId)
  document.body.appendChild(html`
    <div>
      <h2>From ${file.name}</h2>
      <a href=${result.ssl_url}> View </a>
    </div>
  `)
})
```

### `transloadit:complete`

Fired when an assembly completed.

**Parameters**

  - `assembly` - The final assembly status of the completed assembly.

```js
uppy.on('transloadit:complete', (assembly) => {
  // Could do something fun with this!
  console.log(assembly.results)
})
```

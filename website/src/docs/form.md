The `@uppy/form` plugin has several features to integrate with HTML `<form>` elements.

- It collects user-specified metadata from form fields, right before Uppy begins uploading/processing files.
- It can append upload results back to the form as a hidden field. Currently the appended result is a stringified version of a [`result`](/docs/uppy/#uppy-upload) returned from `uppy.upload()` or `complete` event.

```js
const Form = require('@uppy/form')

uppy.use(Form, {
  // Options
})
```

## Installation

This plugin is published as the `@uppy/form` package.

Install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @uppy/form
```

In the [CDN package](/docs/#With-a-script-tag), it is available on the `Uppy` global object:

```js
const Form = Uppy.Form
```

## Options

The `@uppy/form` plugin has the following configurable options:

```js
uppy.use(Form, {
  target: null,
  resultName: 'uppyResult',
  getMetaFromForm: true,
  addResultToForm: true,
  multipleResults: false,
  submitOnSuccess: false,
  triggerUploadOnSubmit: false
})
```

### `id: 'Form'`

A unique identifier for this plugin. It defaults to `'Form'`.

### `target: null`

DOM element or CSS selector for the form element. This is required for the plugin to work.

### `resultName: 'uppyResult'`

The `name` attribute for the `<input type="hidden">` where the result will be added.

### `getMetaFromForm: true`

Configures whether or not to extract metadata from the form. When set to true, the `Form` plugin will extract all fields from a `<form>` element before upload begins. Those fields will then be added to global `uppy.state.meta` and each fileâ€™s meta, and appended as (meta)data to the upload in an object with `[file input name attribute]` -> `[file input value]` key/values.

### `addResultToForm: true`

Configures whether or not to add upload/encoding results back to the form in an `<input name="uppyResult" type="hidden">` element.

### `multipleResults: false`

By default, the Form plugin will _replace_ the `value` of `<input type="hidden">` it adds with the result (if `addResultToForm` is enabled) on each upload / `complete` event. This behavior can be confusing, because if a user uploads a file and then adds another, only the last result will end up in the hidden input and submitted to your server.

Setting `multipleResults: true` turns the value of `<input type="hidden">` into an array and _appends_ each result from `complete` event to it. Since this is likely the desired default behavior in most cases, it will be made default in the next major release of Uppy, the option is kept for backwards compatability.

### `triggerUploadOnSubmit: false`

Configures whether or not to start the upload when the form is submitted. When the user presses a submit button, this will prevent form submission, and instead upload files. You can then:

- use `submitOnSuccess: true` if you need the form to _actually_ be submitted once all files have been uploaded.
- listen for `uppy.on('complete')` to do something else if the file uploads are all you need. For example, if the form is used for file metadata only.

### `submitOnSuccess: false`

Configures whether or not to submit the form after Uppy finishes uploading/encoding.

Uppy provides [React][] components for the included UI plugins.

## Installation

All React components are provided through the `@uppy/react` package.

Install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @uppy/react
```

## Usage

`@uppy/react` exposes component wrappers for `Dashboard`, `DragDrop`, and all other UI elements.
The components can be used with either [React][] or API-compatible alternatives such as [Preact][].

A couple things to keep in mind when using Uppy with React:

* Instead of adding a UI plugin to an Uppy instance with `.use()`, the Uppy instance can be passed into components as an `uppy` prop.
* All other props are passed as options to the plugin.
* The Uppy instance should **not** live inside the component but outside of it.
* You have to pass the IDs of your `use`d plugins to the `plugins` array prop so Dashboard knows it needs to render them.
* An Uppy instance canâ€™t be used by more than one component. Make sure you are using a unique Uppy instance per component.

Here is a basic example:

```js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam'
import { Dashboard } from '@uppy/react'

const uppy = new Uppy().use(Webcam)

function Component () {
  return <Dashboard uppy={uppy} plugins={['Webcam']} />
}
```

## CSS

Make sure to also include the necessary CSS files for each Uppy React component you are using. Follow links for individual components docs below for details on that.

## Components

The following plugins are available as React component wrappers (you need to
install each package separately):

* [\<Dashboard />][<Dashboard />] - renders an inline [`@uppy/dashboard`][].
* [\<DashboardModal />][<DashboardModal />] - renders a [`@uppy/dashboard`][] modal.
* [\<DragDrop />][<DragDrop />] - renders a [`@uppy/drag-drop`][] area.
* [\<ProgressBar />][<ProgressBar />] - renders a [`@uppy/progress-bar`][].
* [\<StatusBar />][<StatusBar />] - renders a [`@uppy/status-bar`][].

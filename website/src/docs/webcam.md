The `@uppy/webcam` plugin lets you take photos and record videos with a built-in camera on desktop and mobile devices.

> To use the Webcam plugin in Chrome, [your site must be served over https](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/chrome-47-webrtc#public_service_announcements). This restriction does not apply on `localhost`, so you don't have to jump through many hoops during development.

```js
const Webcam = require('@uppy/webcam')

uppy.use(Webcam, {
  // Options
})
```

## Installation

This plugin is published as the `@uppy/webcam` package.

Install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @uppy/webcam
```

In the [CDN package](/docs/#With-a-script-tag), it is available on the `Uppy` global object:

```js
const Webcam = Uppy.Webcam
```

## CSS

The `@uppy/webcam` plugin requires the following CSS for styling:

```js
import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css'
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'
```

Import general Core styles from `@uppy/core/dist/style.css` first, then add the Webcam styles from `@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css`. A minified version is also available as `style.min.css` at the same path. The way to do import depends on your build system.

## Options

The `@uppy/webcam` plugin has the following configurable options:

```js
uppy.use(Webcam, {
  onBeforeSnapshot: () => Promise.resolve(),
  countdown: false,
  modes: [
    'video-audio',
    'video-only',
    'audio-only',
    'picture'
  ],
  mirror: true,
  facingMode: 'user',
  showRecordingLength: false,
  preferredVideoMimeType: null,
  preferredImageMimeType: null,
  locale: {}
})
```

### `id: 'Webcam'`

A unique identifier for this plugin. It defaults to `'Webcam'`.

### `title: 'Camera'`

Configures the title / name shown in the UI, for instance, on Dashboard tabs. It defaults to `'Camera'`.

### `target: null`

DOM element, CSS selector, or plugin to mount Webcam into.

### `countdown: false`

When taking a picture: the amount of seconds to wait before actually taking a snapshot. If set to `false` or 0, the timeout is disabled entirely. This also shows a `Smile!` message through the [Informer](/docs/informer) before the picture is taken.

### `onBeforeSnapshot: () => Promise.resolve()`

A hook function to call before a snapshot is taken. The Webcam plugin will wait for the returned Promise to resolve before taking the snapshot. This can be used to implement variations on the `countdown` option for example.

### `modes: []`

The types of recording modes to allow.

 - `video-audio` - Record a video file, capturing both audio and video.
 - `video-only` - Record a video file with the webcam, but don't record audio.
 - `audio-only` - Record an audio file with the user's microphone.
 - `picture` - Take a picture with the webcam.

By default, all modes are allowed, and the Webcam plugin will show controls for recording video as well as taking pictures.

### `mirror: true`

Configures whether or not to mirror preview image from the camera. This option is useful when taking a selfie with a front camera: when you wave your right hand, you will see your hand on the right on the preview screen, like in the mirror. But when you actually take a picture, it will not be mirrored. This is how smartphone selfie cameras behave.

### `facingMode: 'user'`

Devices sometimes have multiple cameras, front and back, for example. There is a browser API to set which camera will be used, [facingMode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints/facingMode):

- `user`: The video source is facing toward the user; this includes, for example, the front-facing camera on a smartphone.
- `environment`:  The video source is facing away from the user, thereby viewing their environment. This is the back camera on a smartphone.
- `left`: The video source is facing toward the user but to their left, such as a camera aimed toward the user but over their left shoulder.
- `right`: The video source is facing toward the user but to their right, such as a camera aimed toward the user but over their right shoulder.

### `showRecordingLength: false`

Configures whether or not to show the length of the recording while the recording is in progress. The default is `false`.

### `preferredVideoMimeType: null`

Set the preferred mime type for video recordings, for example `'video/webm'`. If the browser supports the given mime type, the video will be recorded in this format. If the browser does not support it, it will use the browser default.

If no preferred video mime type is given, the Webcam plugin will prefer types listed in the [`allowedFileTypes` restriction](/docs/uppy/#restrictions), if any.

### `preferredImageMimeType: null`

Set the preferred mime type for images, for example `'image/png'`. If the browser supports rendering the given mime type, the image will be stored in this format. Else `image/jpeg` is used by default.

If no preferred image mime type is given, the Webcam plugin will prefer types listed in the [`allowedFileTypes` restriction](/docs/uppy/#restrictions), if any.

### `locale: {}`

Localize text that is shown to the user.

The default English strings are:

```js
strings: {
  // Shown before a picture is taken when the `countdown` option is set.
  smile: 'Smile!',
  // Used as the label for the button that takes a picture.
  // This is not visibly rendered but is picked up by screen readers.
  takePicture: 'Take a picture',
  // Used as the label for the button that starts a video recording.
  // This is not visibly rendered but is picked up by screen readers.
  startRecording: 'Begin video recording',
  // Used as the label for the button that stops a video recording.
  // This is not visibly rendered but is picked up by screen readers.
  stopRecording: 'Stop video recording',
  // Used as the label for the recording length counter. See the showRecordingLength option.
  // This is not visibly rendered but is picked up by screen readers.
  recordingLength: 'Recording length %{recording_length}',
  // Title on the “allow access” screen
  allowAccessTitle: 'Please allow access to your camera',
  // Description on the “allow access” screen
  allowAccessDescription: 'In order to take pictures or record video with your camera, please allow camera access for this site.'
}
```

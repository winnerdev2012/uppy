Upload files straight to Transloadit from your own custom UI. Give us an array of files, and we'll give you an array of results!

```js
const resultPromise = Robodog.upload(files, {
  params: {
    auth: { key: '' },
    template_id: ''
  }
})
```

`resultPromise` is a [Promise][promise] that resolves with an object:

 - `successful` - An array containing data about files that were uploaded successfully
 - `failed` - An array containing data about files that failed to upload
 - `transloadit` - An array of Assembly statuses

## `files`

An array of [File][file] objects, obtained from an `<input type="file">` or elsewhere.

These can also be [Blob][blob]s with a `.name` property. That way you can upload files that were created using JavaScript.

## Transloadit

All the options to the [Transloadit][tl-options] plugin are supported.

Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Items can be optionally be tagged tagged by GitHub owner issue if discussion
happened / is needed.

Please add your entries in this format:

Following [SemVer spec item 4](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4),
we're `<1.0.0` and allowing ourselves to make breaking changes in minor

## Backlog

Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point

- [ ] build: go over `package.json` together and clean up npm run scripts (@arturi, @hedgerh, @kvz)
- [ ] build: investigate Rollup someday, for tree-shaking and smaller dist https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1379#issuecomment-183383199, https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollupify, https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollup-comparison
- [ ] core: Decouple rendering from Plugins and try to make Uppy work with React (add basic example) to remain aware of possible issues (@hedgerh), look at https://github.com/akiran/react-slick, https://github.com/nosir/cleave.js
- [ ] core: Have base styles, be explicit about fonts, etc
- [ ] core: Make sure Uppy works well in VR
- [ ] dashboard: add ability to minimize Modal/Dashboard, while long upload is in progress? Uppy then becomes just a tiny progress indicator
- [ ] test: Human should check http://www.webpagetest.org and https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/, use it sometimes to test website and Uppy. Will show response/loading times and other issues
- [ ] test: Human should test with real screen reader to identify accessibility problems
- [ ] test: add https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y for automated accessibility testing
- [ ] test: Make Edge and Safari work via the tunnel so we can test localhost instead of uppy.io, and test the current build, vs the previous deploy that way
- [ ] test: setup an HTML page with all sorts of crazy styles, resets & bootstrap to see what brakes Uppy (@arturi)
- [ ] website: scrollbars on code samples (can’t reproduce!) (@arturi)
- [ ] dependencies: es6-promise --> lie https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie ?
- [ ] core: accessibility research: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb, http://khan.github.io/tota11y/
- [ ] core: restrictions — by file type, size, number of files
- [ ] core: see if it’s possible to add webworkers or use pica for thumbnail generation (@arturi)
- [ ] website: Would one really connect a own google drive or dropbox for testing purpose? => maybe one can give something like a testing account of google drive and dropbox to try uppy
- [ ] meta: Set up a Google testing account that people can use to try the demo (@hedgerh)
- [ ] dashboard: maybe add perfect scrollbar https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar (@arturi)
- [ ] core: try file-type module for setting correct mime-types if needed, example: http://requirebin.com/?gist=f9bea9602030f1320a227cf7f140c45f, http://stackoverflow.com/a/29672957
- [ ] uppy-server: pluggable custom providers; Maybe we use a config file or make it similar to how uppy adds plugins (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] ui: do we want https://github.com/kazzkiq/balloon.css ?
- [ ] core: consider adding nanoraf https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo/pull/135/files?diff=unified (@arturi)

## 0.16.0

- [ ] instagram: Make a barely working Instagram Plugin (#21)
- [ ] dashboard: add service logo / name to the selected file in file list (@arturi)
- [ ] uppy/uppy-server: review webscoket connection flow during remote upload. In a situation where a client has a slow internet connection, the uppy-server may complete an upload before the client connects to the websocket, hence no feedback would be sent to the client and the client remains unaware of the upload status.
- [ ] provider: improve UI: add icons for file types (@arturi)
- [ ] provider: improve UI: improve overall look, breadcrumbs (@arturi)
- [ ] provider: improve UI: steps towards making it responsive (@arturi)

- [ ] server: begin adding automated tests, maybe try https://facebook.github.io/jest (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] server: add image preview / thumbnail for remote files, if its in the API of services ? (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] uppy/uppy-server: allow google drive/dropbox non-tus (i.e multipart) remote uploads
- [ ] dashboard: see if transitions can be fixed in Firefox (@arturi)
- [ ] uploaders: make sure uploads retry/resume if started when offline or disconnected (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] uploaders: retry when back online / failed https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/135 (@arturi)
- [ ] server: research having less permissions, smaller auth expiration time for security ? (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] server: what if smth changed in GDrive while it was open in Uppy? refresh file list? (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] core: research !important styles to be immune to any environment/page. Maybe use smth like https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-safe-important. Or increase specificity (with .Uppy) (@arturi)
- [ ] core: file type detection: archives, markdown (possible modules: file-type, identify-filetype) (@arturi)
- [ ] server: consider not showing progress updates from the server after an upload’s been paused (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] server: throttle progress updates sent through websockets, sometimes it can get overwhelming when uploads are fast (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] server: research parallelizing downloading/uploading remote files: start uploading chunks right away, while still storing the file on disk (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] dashboard: show status “Upload started...” when the remote upload has begun, but no progress events received yet (@arturi)
- [ ] server: delete file from local disk after upload is successful (@ifedapoolarewaju)

Uppy is a sleek, modular file uploader that integrates seemlessly with any application. It‚Äôs fast, easy to use and lets you worry about more important problems than building a file uploader.

- **Fetch** files from local disk, Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, or snap and record selfies with a¬†camera;
- **Preview** and edit metadata with a nice interface;
- **Upload** to the final destination, optionally processing/encoding on the way;

**[Read the docs](http://uppy.io/docs)** | **[Try Uppy](http://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/)**

Uppy is being developed by the [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) team.

## Example

<img width="700" alt="Uppy UI Demo: modal dialog with a few selected files and an upload button" src="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/raw/master/uppy-screenshot.jpg">

```js
const Uppy = require('uppy/lib/core')
const Dashboard = require('uppy/lib/plugins/Dashboard')
const Webcam = require('uppy/lib/plugins/Webcam')
const GoogleDrive = require('uppy/lib/plugins/GoogleDrive')
const Tus = require('uppy/lib/plugins/Tus')

const uppy = Uppy({ autoProceed: false })
  .use(Dashboard, { trigger: '#select-files' })
  .use(Webcam, { target: Dashboard })
  .use(GoogleDrive, { target: Dashboard, host: 'https://server.uppy.io' })
  .use(Tus, { endpoint: '://master.tus.io/files/' })
  .run()
  .on('core:success', files => console.log(`Successfully uploaded these files: ${files}`))
```

## Features

- Lightweight, modular plugin-based architecture, easy on dependencies :zap:
- Resumable file uploads via the open [tus](http://tus.io/) standard
- Supports picking files from: Webcam, Dropbox, Google Drive, Instagram, bypassing the user‚Äôs device where possible, syncing between servers directly via [uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server)
- Works great with file encoding and processing backends, such as [Transloadit](http://transloadit.com), works great without (just roll your own Apache/Nginx/Node/etc backend)
- Sleek user interface :sparkles:
- Optional file recovering (after a browser crash) with [Golden Retriever](https://uppy.io/docs/golden-retriever/)
- Speaks multiple languages (i18n) :earth_africa:
- Built with accessibility in mind
- Free for the world, forever (as in beer üç∫, pizza üçï, and liberty üóΩ)
- Cute as a puppy, also accepts cat pictures :dog:

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install uppy --save
```

We recommend installing from NPM and then using a module bundler such as [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/).

Add CSS [uppy.min.css](https://unpkg.com/uppy/dist/uppy.min.css), either to `<head>` of your HTML page or include in JS, if your bundler of choice supports it ‚Äî transforms and plugins are available for Browserify and Webpack.

If you like, you can also use a pre-built bundle, for example from [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/uppy/). In that case `Uppy` will attach itself to the global `window.Uppy` object.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The bundle currently consists of most Uppy plugins, so this method is not recommended for production, as your users will have to download all plugins, when you are likely using just a few.

1\. Add a script to the bottom of `<body>`:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/uppy"></script>
```

2\. Add CSS to `<head>`:
``` html
<link href="https://unpkg.com/uppy/dist/uppy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

3\. Initialize:

``` html
<script>
  var uppy = Uppy.Core()
  uppy.use(Uppy.DragDrop, { target: '.UppyDragDrop' })
  uppy.use(Uppy.Tus, { endpoint: '//master.tus.io/files/' })
  uppy.run()
</script>
```

## FAQ

### React support?

Yep. Uppy-React component is in the works, in the meantime you can just use it as any other lib with React, [see here](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/uppy-react/src/uppy-react).

### Can I use it with Rails/Node/Go/PHP?

Yes, whatever you want on the backend will work with `XHRUpload` plugin, since it just does a `POST` or `PUT` request. If you want resumability, use [one of tus implementations](http://tus.io/implementations.html) üëåüèº

### Do I need to install special service/server for it?

No, as mentioned previously, `XHRUpload` plugin is old-school and just works with everything. However, you need [`uppy-server`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server) if you‚Äôd like your users to be able to pick files from Google Drive or Dropbox (more services coming). And you can add [tus](http://tus.io) if you want resumability.

### Does Uppy support S3 uploads?

Yes, since 0.18, there is an S3 plugin. Check out the [docs](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3/) for more information.

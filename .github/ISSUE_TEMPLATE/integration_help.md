Transloadit is providing Uppy free of charge. If you want you can self-host all components and never pay us a dime. There's docs and tests and your Bugs and Feature Requests are always welcome on GitHub. 

There is also a different category of support that we'd like to call Integration Help: making things work for you, that are already reported working for the larger community.

As much as we'd like to provide detailed integration help to each non-paying user, Uppy has reached a point where this is no longer sustainable for our small crew. We end up investing our time in a million different projects, but without money flowing back, we can't ramp up our team along with the demand, spreading our team ever thinner, eventually grinding development to a halt.

This is not where we want to be, so in order to offer enthusiasts, businesses, and enterprises assistance in a sustainable way, we're providing community based integration help for free at <https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy>, and offer business paid support via <https://uppy.io/support>.
